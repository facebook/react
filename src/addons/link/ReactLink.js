/**
 * ReactLink encapsulates a common pattern in which a component wants to modify
 * a prop received from its parent. ReactLink allows the parent to pass down a
 * value coupled with a callback that, when invoked, expresses an intent to
 * modify that value. For example:
 *
 * React.createClass({
 *   getInitialState: function() {
 *     return {value: ''};
 *   },
 *   render: function() {
 *     var valueLink = new ReactLink(this.state.value, this._handleValueChange);
 *     return <input valueLink={valueLink} />;
 *   },
 *   this._handleValueChange: function(newValue) {
 *     this.setState({value: newValue});
 *   }
 * });
 *
 * We have provided some sugary mixins to make the creation and
 * consumption of ReactLink easier; see LinkedValueMixin and LinkedStateMixin.
