/**
 * Module that is injectable into `EventPluginHub`, that specifies a
 * deterministic ordering of `EventPlugin`s. A convenient way to reason about
 * plugins, without having to package every one of them. This is better than
 * having plugins be ordered in the same order that they are injected because
 * that ordering would be influenced by the packaging order.
 * `ResponderEventPlugin` must occur before `SimpleEventPlugin` so that
 * preventing default on events is convenient in `SimpleEventPlugin` handlers.
