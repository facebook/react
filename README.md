React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

* **Declarative:** React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug.
* **Component-Based:** Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep the state out of the DOM.
* **Learn Once, Write Anywhere:** We don't make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/).

## Installation

React has been designed for gradual adoption from the start, and **you can use as little or as much React as you need**:

* Use [Online Playgrounds](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html#online-playgrounds) to get a taste of React.
* [Add React to a Website](https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html) as a `<script>` tag in one minute.
* [Create a New React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) if you're looking for a powerful JavaScript toolchain.

You can use React as a `<script>` tag from a [CDN](https://reactjs.org/docs/cdn-links.html), or as a `react` package on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react).

## Documentation

You can find the Rea it faster and easier to use. Development of React happens in the open on GitHub, and we are grateful to the community for contributing bugfixes and improvements. Read below to learn how you can take part in improving React.
