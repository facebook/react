# Contributing Enhanced Conditional Hooks Validation to React Compiler

## Overview

This document outlines our contribution to the React Compiler project, specifically enhancing conditional hooks validation with patterns identified in **PR #34116** and other real-world scenarios.

## Problem Statement

While the React Compiler already includes comprehensive hook validation in `ValidateHooksUsage.ts`, our analysis of production React applications and specific issues like **PR #34116** revealed additional patterns that needed explicit validation:

### Key Issues Addressed

1. **Early Return Pattern (PR #34116)** - Components that return early and then call hooks
2. **Complex Conditional Structures** - Nested conditionals, switch statements, and ternary operators
3. **Enhanced Error Messages** - More specific error descriptions for common violations
4. **Real-world Pattern Detection** - Patterns found in production codebases

## Technical Approach

### Current State Analysis

The existing `ValidateHooksUsage.ts` already provides:
- ✅ Basic conditional hook detection using `computeUnconditionalBlocks`
- ✅ Hook classification system (KnownHook, PotentialHook, etc.)
- ✅ Error reporting with proper severity levels
- ✅ Support for method calls and function expressions

### Our Enhancement Strategy

Instead of duplicating functionality, we propose:

1. **Enhance Error Messages**: Add specific references to PR #34116 patterns
2. **Add Configuration Options**: Allow fine-tuning of validation behavior
3. **Improve Documentation**: Better examples of detected patterns
4. **Add CLI Tooling**: Production-ready command-line interface

## Files in This Contribution

### Core Validation (Enhanced)
- `src/Validation/ValidateConditionalHooksUsage.ts` - Enhanced validation with PR #34116 patterns
- `src/Validation/ConditionalHooksConfig.ts` - Advanced configuration system
- `src/Validation/ConditionalHooksDemo.ts` - Comprehensive pattern examples

### CLI Tooling
- `src/cli/ConditionalHooksValidator.ts` - Production CLI tool
- `package-cli.json` - Package configuration for CLI distribution

### Testing and Integration
- `src/Validation/ValidateConditionalHooksUsage.test.ts` - Core validation tests
- `src/Validation/ValidateConditionalHooksUsage.integration.test.ts` - Real-world integration tests
- `.github/workflows/conditional-hooks-validator.yml` - CI/CD pipeline

### Documentation
- `README-ConditionalHooks.md` - Comprehensive user documentation
- `CONTRIBUTING_CONDITIONAL_HOOKS.md` - This file

## Integration Strategy

### Option 1: Enhance Existing ValidateHooksUsage.ts

```typescript
// Add PR #34116 specific error messages to existing validation
function recordConditionalHookError(place: Place): void {
  const reason = place.isAfterEarlyReturn 
    ? 'Hook called after early return. This pattern was identified in PR #34116 and can cause "Rendered more hooks than during the previous render" errors. See the Rules of Hooks (https://react.dev/warnings/invalid-hook-call-warning)'
    : 'Hooks must always be called in a consistent order, and may not be called conditionally. See the Rules of Hooks (https://react.dev/warnings/invalid-hook-call-warning)';
  
  // ... existing error recording logic
}
```

### Option 2: Add Complementary Validation Plugin

Keep our `ValidateConditionalHooksUsage.ts` as a complementary plugin that:
- Runs alongside the existing validation
- Provides enhanced error messages for specific patterns
- Offers additional configuration options
- Maintains backward compatibility

### Option 3: CLI-Only Contribution

Contribute the CLI tooling without modifying core validation:
- Provides standalone validation tool for developers
- Uses existing React Compiler validation internally  
- Offers enhanced reporting and auto-fix capabilities

## Recommended Approach: Option 2 (Complementary Plugin)

We recommend **Option 2** because it:

1. **Preserves Existing Functionality** - No risk of breaking existing validation
2. **Provides Enhanced Value** - Additional patterns and better error messages
3. **Allows Gradual Adoption** - Teams can opt into enhanced validation
4. **Maintains Compatibility** - Works alongside existing validation pipeline

### Implementation Plan

1. **Keep our enhanced validation as a separate plugin**
2. **Export it from the validation index** (already done)
3. **Add configuration option to enable enhanced validation**
4. **Update pipeline to run both validations when enabled**

## Configuration Integration

### Environment Config Enhancement

```typescript
// src/HIR/Environment.ts
export const EnvironmentConfigSchema = z.object({
  // ... existing config
  validateHooksUsage: z.boolean().default(true),
  
  // New: Enhanced conditional hooks validation
  enhancedConditionalHooksValidation: z.boolean().default(false),
  conditionalHooksConfig: z.object({
    detectEarlyReturnPatterns: z.boolean().default(true),
    detectNestedConditionals: z.boolean().default(true),
    detectSwitchStatements: z.boolean().default(true),
    maxNestingDepth: z.number().default(3),
    includePatternExamples: z.boolean().default(true)
  }).optional(),
});
```

### Pipeline Integration

```typescript
// src/Entrypoint/Pipeline.ts
export function compileFn(
  fn: (string | BabelTypes.Node)[],
  config: CompilerConfig
): CompilerPipelineValue {
  // ... existing pipeline
  
  if (env.config.validateHooksUsage) {
    validateHooksUsage(hir).unwrap();
    
    // Enhanced validation if enabled
    if (env.config.enhancedConditionalHooksValidation) {
      validateConditionalHooksUsage(hir).unwrap();
    }
  }
  
  // ... rest of pipeline
}
```
