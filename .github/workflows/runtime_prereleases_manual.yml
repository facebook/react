      # The tags to use when publishing canaries. The main one we should
      # always include is "canary" but we can use multiple (e.g. alpha,
      # beta, rc). To declare multiple, use a comma-separated string, like
      # this:
      #   dist_tag: "canary,alpha,beta,rc"
      #
      # TODO: We currently tag canaries with "next" in addition to "canary"
      # because this used to be called the "next" channel and some
      # downstream consumers might still expect that tag. We can remove this
      # after some time has elapsed and the change has been communicated.
