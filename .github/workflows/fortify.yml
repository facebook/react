# Use this workflow template as a basis for integrating Fortify on Demand Static Application Security Testing(SAST) into your GitHub workflows.#
# This template demonstrates the steps to prepare the code+dependencies, initiate a scan, download results once complete and import into       #
# GitHub Security Code Scanning Alerts. Existing customers should review inputs and environment variables below to configure scanning against  #
# an existing application in your Fortify on Demand tenant. Additional information is available in the comments throughout the workflow, the   #
# documentation for the Fortify actions used, and the Fortify on Demand / ScanCentral Client product documentation. If you need additional     #
# assistance with configuration, feel free to create a help ticket in the Fortify on Demand portal.                                            #
