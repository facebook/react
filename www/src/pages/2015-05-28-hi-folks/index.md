Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia
and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in
Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language
ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it
with the necessary regelialia.

## On deer horse aboard tritely yikes and much

The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of
bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little
Blind Text didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial
into the belt and made herself on the way.

*   Well uncritical so misled
    *   this is very interesting

When she reached the first hills of the **Italic Mountains**, she
had a last view back on the skyline of her
hometown _Bookmarksgrove_, the headline of [Alphabet
Village](http://google.com) and the subline of her own road, the
Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she
continued her way. On her way she met a copy.

### Overlaid the jeepers uselessly much excluding

But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take
long until a few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk
with [Longe and Parole](http://google.com) and dragged her into
their agency, where they abused her for their projects again and
again. And if she hasn’t been rewritten, then they are still using
her.

It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences
fly into your mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control
about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day
however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum
decided to leave for the far World of Grammar.

### According a funnily until pre-set or arrogant well cheerful

left from its origin would be the word "and" and the Little Blind
Text should turn around and return to its own, safe country. But
