# Fix false positive ref access in render error when props contain both a ref and a value

## Issue
Issue #34358: false positive ref access in render error when props contain both a ref and a value.

## Root Cause
The linter flags passing a ref to a function even when the ref is passed along with other non-ref values, assuming the function may access the ref during render. However, when both ref and value are present in props and passed together, it may be safe if the function only accesses the value.

## Plan
1. Modify `ValidateNoRefAccessInRender.ts` to skip flagging ref operands in function calls if there is at least one non-ref operand in the same call.
2. Add test cases to cover the fix: cases where ref is passed with value should not error, cases where ref is passed alone should still error.
3. Ensure no regressions in existing tests.

## Files to Edit
- `compiler/packages/babel-plugin-react-compiler/src/Validation/ValidateNoRefAccessInRender.ts`
- Test fixtures in `compiler/packages/babel-plugin-react-compiler/src/__tests__/fixtures/compiler/`

## Followup Steps
- Run tests to verify the fix.
- Submit PR with reference to issue #34358.

## Completed Tasks
- Modified `ValidateNoRefAccessInRender.ts` to add logic for skipping ref validation when non-ref operands are present.
- Added test case `allow-passing-ref-with-value-prop.js` and `.expect.md` for the allowed scenario.
- Added test case `error.invalid-pass-ref-alone.js` and `.expect.md` for the error scenario.
