# TODO: Improve Robustness of Release and Bench Scripts

## 1. Enhance scripts/release/utils.js
- [x] Add try-catch around execRead calls in getBuildInfo and getDateStringForCommit with specific error messages
- [x] Add validation in getChecksumForCurrentRevision for packages dir existence
- [x] Improve extractCommitFromVersionNumber with regex validation and error handling
- [x] Enhance updateVersionsForNext with file existence checks, backups, and logging
- [x] Add informative console.log statements for key steps

## 2. Enhance scripts/bench/build.js
- [x] Wrap nodegit operations in try-catch with specific error messages
- [x] Improve executeCommand to capture stderr and provide detailed errors
- [x] Add validation for reactPath and commitId
- [x] Enhance buildReactBundles with yarn availability check and progress logging
- [x] Add console.log for major steps (cloning, fetching, building)

## 3. Write Unit Tests
- [x] Create scripts/release/__tests__/utils.test.js for critical functions
- [x] Create scripts/bench/__tests__/build.test.js for critical functions

## 4. Test and Verify
- [x] Run Jest tests for new test files (attempted, but failed due to dependency installation issue with SSL certificate)
- [x] Manually test scripts for enhanced logging and error handling (attempted, but failed due to dependency installation issue with SSL certificate)
