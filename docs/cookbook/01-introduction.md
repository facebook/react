The React.js cookbook provides solutions for common questions asked when working with the React framework. It's written in the [cookbook format](http://shop.oreilly.com/category/series/cookbooks.do) commonly used by O'Reilly Media. See [Inline Styles](/react/cookbook/inline-styles.html) recipe as an example.
