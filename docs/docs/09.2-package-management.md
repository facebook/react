## CDN-hosted React

We provide CDN-hosted versions of React [on our download page](/react/downloads.html). These pre-built files use the UMD module format. Dropping them in with a simple `<script>` tag will inject the `React` and `ReactDOM` globals into your environment. It should also work out-of-the-box in CommonJS and AMD environments.


## Using React from npm

You can use React with a CommonJS module system like [browserify](http://browserify.org/) or [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/). Use the [`react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react) and [`react-dom`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom) npm packages.

```js
// main.js
var React = require('react');
var ReactDOM = require('react-dom');

ReactDOM.render(
  <h1>Hello, world!</h1>,
  document.getElementById('example')
);
```

Configure [babel](https://babeljs.io/) with a `.babelrc` file:
 
 ```json
 { "presets": ["react"] }
 ```
 
 > Note:
 >
 > If you are using ES2015, you will want to also use the `babel-preset-es2015` package.


To install React DOM and build your bundle with browserify:

```sh
$ npm install --save react react-dom babelify babel-preset-react
$ browserify -t [ babelify ] main.js -o bundle.js
```

To install React DOM and build your bundle with webpack:

```sh
$ npm install --save react react-dom babel-preset-react babel-loader babel-core
$ webpack main.js bundle.js --module-bind 'js=babel-loader'
```

> Note:
>
> If you are using ES2015, you will want to also use the `babel-preset-es2015` package.

**Note:** by default, React will be in development mode, which is slower, and not advised for production. To use React in production mode, set the environment variable `NODE_ENV` to `production` (using envify or webpack's DefinePlugin). For example:

```js
new webpack.DefinePlugin({
  "process.env": {
    NODE_ENV: JSON.stringify("production")
  }
});
```

Update your HTML file as below:

```html{8,12}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>Hello React!</title>
    <script src="build/react.js"></script>
    <script src="build/react-dom.js"></script>
    <!-- No need for Babel! -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="example"></div>
    <script src="build/helloworld.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Using React from Bower

Bower is a package manager optimized for the front-end development. If multiple packages depend on a package - jQuery for example - Bower will download jQuery just once. This is known as a flat dependency graph and it helps reduce page load. For more info, visit [http://bower.io/](http://bower.io/).

If you'd like to use bower, it's as easy as:

```
bower install --save react
```

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>Hello React!</title>
    <script src="bower_components/react/react.js"></script>
    <script src="bower_components/react/react-dom.js"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/babel-core@5.8.38/browser.min.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="example"></div>
    <script type="text/babel">
      ReactDOM.render(
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>,
        document.getElementById('example')
      );
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```


## Using master

We have instructions for building from `master` [in our GitHub repository](https://github.com/facebook/react).
