React and [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components) are built to solve different problems.  Web Components provide strong encapsulation for reusable components, while React provides a declarative library that keeps the DOM in sync with your data. The two goals are complementary.  As a developer, you are free to use React in your Web Components, or to use WebComponents in React, or both.

## Using Web Components in React

```javascript
class HelloMessage extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <div>Hello <x-search>{this.props.name}</x-search>!</div>;
  }
}
```

> Note:
>
> Web Components often expose an imperative API. For instance, a `video` Web Component might expose `play()` and `pause()` functions). To access the imperative APIs of a Web Component, you will need to use a ref to interact with the DOM node directly. If you are using third-party Web Components, the best solution is to write a React component that behaves as a wrapper for your Web Component.
>
> Events emitted by a Web Component may not properly propagate through a React render tree.
> You will need to manually attach event handlers to handle these events within your React components.


## Using React in your Web Components

```javascript
var proto = Object.create(HTMLElement.prototype, {
  attachedCallback: {
    value: function() {
      var mountPoint = document.createElement('span');
      this.createShadowRoot().appendChild(mountPoint);

      var name = this.getAttribute('name');
      var url = 'https://www.google.com/search?q=' + encodeURIComponent(name);
      ReactDOM.render(<a href={url}>{name}</a>, mountPoint);
    }
  }
});
document.registerElement('x-search', {prototype: proto});
```
