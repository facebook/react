It's been less than a week since we shipped v0.13.0 but it's time to do another quick release. We just released v0.13.1 which contains bugfixes for a number of small issues.

Thanks all of you who have been upgrading your applications and taking the time to report issues. And a huge thank you to those of you who submitted pull requests for the issues you found! 2 of the 6 fixes that went out today came from people who aren't on the core team!
