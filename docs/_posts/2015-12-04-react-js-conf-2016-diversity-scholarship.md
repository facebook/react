title: React.js Conf 2016 Diversity Scholarship

I am thrilled to announced that we will be organizing another diversity scholarship program for the upcoming React.js Conf! The tech industry is suffering from a lack of diversity, but it's important to us that we have a thriving community that is made up of people with a variety of experiences and viewpoints.

When we ran this program last year, we had *over 200* people apply for only 10 tickets. There were so many people that we wanted to bring in but we couldn't. The results were still awesome, and we had bright individuals from around the world attending who would have otherwise been unable to. These attendees took part in discussions at the conference and brought perspectives that we might not have otherwise seen there.

This year we're excited to bring back the scholarship, but we've set aside **40 tickets** because we really believe that it's important to do our best to make sure we have an even more diverse audience.

This is something I'm personally really excited to be a part of. I know the rest of the team is as well. We're really proud to have everyone at Facebook providing support and funding for this.

The details of the scholarship are provided below (or you can [go directly to the application](http://goo.gl/forms/PEmKj8oUp4)). I encourage you to apply! If you don't feel like you are eligible yourself, you can still help – send this along to friends, family, coworkers, acquaintances, or anybody who might be interested. And even if you haven't spoken before, please consider [submitting a proposal for a talk](http://conf.reactjs.com/) (either 30 minutes or just 5 minutes) - we're hoping to have a very diverse group of speakers in addition to attendees.

React opens a world of new possibilities such as server-side rendering, real-time updates, different rendering targets like SVG and canvas.

At Facebook, we believe that anyone anywhere can make a positive impact by developing products to make the world more open and connected to the people and things they care about.
