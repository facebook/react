It's exciting to see the number of real-world React applications and components skyrocket over the past months! This community round-up features a few examples of inspiring React applications and components.

## React in the Real World

### Facebook Lookback video editor
Large parts of Facebook's web frontend are already powered by React. The recently released Facebook [Lookback video and its corresponding editor](https://www.facebook.com/lookback/edit/) are great examples of a complex, real-world React app.

### Russia's largest bank is now powered by React
Sberbank, Russia's largest bank, recently switched large parts of their site to use React, as detailed in [this post by Vyacheslav Slinko](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/reactjs/Kj6WATX0atg).

### Relato
[Relato](https://bripkens.github.io/relato/) by [Ben Ripkens](https://github.com/bripkens) shows Open Source Statistics based on npm data. It features a filterable and sortable table built in React. Check it out &ndash; it's super fast!

### Makona Editor

 John Lynch ([@johnrlynch](https://twitter.com/johnrlynch)) created Makona, a block-style document editor for the web. Blocks of different content types comprise documents, authored using plain markup. At the switch of a toggle, block contents are then rendered on the page. While not quite a WYSIWYG editor, Makona uses plain textareas for input. This makes it compatible with a wider range of platforms than traditional rich text editors.

### Create Chrome extensions using React
React is in no way limited to just web pages. Brandon Tilley ([@BinaryMuse](https://twitter.com/BinaryMuse)) just released a detailed walk-through of [how he built his Chrome extension "Fast Tab Switcher" using React](http://brandontilley.com/2014/02/24/creating-chrome-extensions-with-react.html).

### Sproutsheet

[Sproutsheet](http://sproutsheet.com/) is a gardening calendar. You can use it to track certain events that happen in the life of your plants. It's currently in beta and supports localStorage, and data/image import and export.

### Instant Domain Search
[Instant Domain Search](https://instantdomainsearch.com/) also uses React. It sure is instant!

### ReactJS Gallery

[Emanuele Rampichini](https://github.com/lele85)'s [ReactJS Gallery](https://github.com/lele85/ReactGallery) is a cool demo app that shows fullscreen images from a folder on the server. If the folder content changes, the gallery app updates via websockets.

### Input with placeholder shim
