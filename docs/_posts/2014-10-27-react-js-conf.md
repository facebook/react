Every few weeks someone asks us when we are going to organize a conference for React. Our answer has always been "some day". In the mean time, people have been talking about React at other JavaScript conferences around the world. But now the time has finally come for us to have a conference of our own.

**We're happy to announce [React.js Conf](http://conf.reactjs.com/)! It will take place January 28-29, 2015 on Facebook's campus in Menlo Park, California.**

Before we open registration, [we're looking for great talks](http://conf.reactjs.com/call-for-presenters.html). We want to see how you pushed application development forward! If you ever talked to a meet-up, pitched React to your co-workers, or done something awesome and want to talk about it, let us know!

Here are some areas of research we want to explore during the conference if you need some inspiration: server-side rendering, data fetching, language features (eg es6, clojure), immutability, rendering targets (eg svg, canvas), real-time updates...

We look forward to seeing many of you in person in just a few short months!
