  <b>This page includes an extra development build of React. &#x1f6a7;</b>
</p>
<p>
  The React build on this page includes both development and production versions because dead code elimination has not been applied correctly.
  <br />
  <br />
  This makes its size larger, and causes React to run slower.
  <br />
  <br />
  Make sure to <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/optimizing-performance.html#use-the-production-build">set up dead code elimination</a> before deployment.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
  Open the developer tools, and the React tab will appear to the right.
