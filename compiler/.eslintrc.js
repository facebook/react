 * Our philosophy for linting is that lints should be very high-signal:
 * - Error, don't warn. If it's worth mentioning it's worth fixing.
 * - Enable rules that consistently identify real problems. If we frequently would have to
 *   disable the rule due to false positives, it isn't high-signal.
 * - Enable rules that help improve consistent style (to avoid code review about style rather
 *   than substance).
