/**
 * If a function captures a mutable value but never gets called, we don't infer a
 * mutable range for that function. This means that we also don't alias the function
 * with its mutable captures.
 *
 * This case is tricky, because we don't generally know for sure what is a mutation
 * and what may just be a normal function call. For example:
 *
 * ```
 * hook useFoo() {
 *   const x = makeObject();
 *   return () => {
 *     return readObject(x); // could be a mutation!
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * If we pessimistically assume that all such cases are mutations, we'd have to group
 * lots of memo scopes together unnecessarily. However, if there is definitely a mutation:
 *
 * ```
 * hook useFoo(createEntryForKey) {
 *   const cache = new WeakMap();
 *   return (key) => {
 *     let entry = cache.get(key);
 *     if (entry == null) {
 *       entry = createEntryForKey(key);
 *       cache.set(key, entry); // known mutation!
 *     }
 *     return entry;
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Then we have to ensure that the function and its mutable captures alias together and
 * end up in the same scope. However, aliasing together isn't enough if the function
 * and operands all have empty mutable ranges (end = start + 1).
 *
 * This pass finds function expressions and object methods that have an empty mutable range
 * and known-mutable operands which also don't have a mutable range, and ensures that the
 * function and those operands are aliased together *and* that their ranges are updated to
 * end after the function expression. This is sufficient to ensure that a reactive scope is
 * created for the alias set.
