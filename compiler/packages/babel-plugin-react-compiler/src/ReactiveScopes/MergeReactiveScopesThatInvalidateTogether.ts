/*
 * The primary goal of this pass is to reduce memoization overhead, specifically:
 * - Use fewer memo slots
 * - Reduce the number of comparisons and other memoization-related instructions
 *
 * The algorithm merges in two main cases: consecutive scopes that invalidate together
 * or nested scopes that invalidate together
 *
 * ## Consecutive Scopes
 *
 * The idea is that if two consecutive scopes would always invalidate together,
 * it's more efficient to group the scopes together to save on memoization overhead.
 *
 * This optimization is necessarily somewhat limited. First, we only merge
 * scopes that are in the same (reactive) block, ie we don't merge across
 * control-flow or block-scoping boundaries. Second, we can only merge scopes
 * so long as any intermediate instructions are safe to memoize — specifically,
 * as long as the values created by those instructions are only referenced by
 * the second scope and not elsewhere. This is to avoid changing control-flow
 * and to avoid increasing the number of scope outputs (which defeats the optimization).
 *
 * With that in mind we can apply the optimization in two cases. Given a block with
 * scope A, some safe-to-memoize instructions I, and scope B, we can merge scopes when:
 * - A and B have identical dependencies. This means they will invalidate together, so
 *    by merging the scopes we can avoid duplicate cache slots and duplicate checks of
 *    those dependencies.
 * - The output of A is the input to B. Any invalidation of A will change its output
 *    which invalidates B, so we can similarly merge scopes. Note that this optimization
 *    may not be beneficial if the outupts of A are not guaranteed to change if its input
 *    changes, but in practice this is generally the case.
 *
 * ## Nested Scopes
 *
 * In this case, if an inner scope has the same dependencies as its parent, then we can
 * flatten away the inner scope since it will always invalidate at the same time.
 *
 * Note that PropagateScopeDependencies propagates scope dependencies upwards. This ensures
 * that parent scopes have the union of their own direct dependencies as well as those of
 * their (transitive) children. As a result nested scopes may have the same or fewer
 * dependencies than their parents, but not more dependencies. If they have fewer dependncies,
 * it means that the inner scope does not always invalidate with the parent and we should not
 * flatten. If they inner scope has the exact same dependencies, however, then it's always
 * better to flatten.
