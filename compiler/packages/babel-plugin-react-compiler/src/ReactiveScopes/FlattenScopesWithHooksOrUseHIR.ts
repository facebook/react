/**
 * For simplicity the majority of compiler passes do not treat hooks specially. However, hooks are different
 * from regular functions in two key ways:
 * - They can introduce reactivity even when their arguments are non-reactive (accounted for in InferReactivePlaces)
 * - They cannot be called conditionally
 *
 * The `use` operator is similar:
 * - It can access context, and therefore introduce reactivity
 * - It can be called conditionally, but _it must be called if the component needs the return value_. This is because
 *   React uses the fact that use was called to remember that the component needs the value, and that changes to the
 *   input should invalidate the component itself.
 *
 * This pass accounts for the "can't call conditionally" aspect of both hooks and use. Though the reasoning is slightly
 * different for reach, the result is that we can't memoize scopes that call hooks or use since this would make them
 * called conditionally in the output.
 *
 * The pass finds and removes any scopes that transitively contain a hook or use call. By running all
 * the reactive scope inference first, agnostic of hooks, we know that the reactive scopes accurately
 * describe the set of values which "construct together", and remove _all_ that memoization in order
 * to ensure the hook call does not inadvertently become conditional.
