 * Internal validation pass that checks all the instructions involved in creating
 * values for a given scope are within the corresponding ReactiveScopeBlock. Errors
 * in HIR/ReactiveFunction structure and alias analysis could theoretically create
 * a structure such as:
 *
 * Function
 *    LabelTerminal
 *     Instruction in scope 0
 *    Instruction in scope 0
 *
 * Because ReactiveScopeBlocks are closed when their surrounding block ends, this
 * structure would create reactive scopes as follows:
 *
 * Function
 *    LabelTerminal
 *      ReactiveScopeBlock scope=0
 *        Instruction in scope 0
 *    Instruction in scope 0
 *
 * This pass asserts we didn't accidentally end up with such a structure, as a guard
 * against compiler coding mistakes in earlier passes.
