Found 1 error:

Error: Cannot reassign variables declared outside of the component/hook

Variable `x` is declared outside of the component/hook. Reassigning this value during render is a form of side effect, which can cause unpredictable behavior depending on when the component happens to re-render. If this variable is used in rendering, use useState instead. Otherwise, consider updating it in an effect.
