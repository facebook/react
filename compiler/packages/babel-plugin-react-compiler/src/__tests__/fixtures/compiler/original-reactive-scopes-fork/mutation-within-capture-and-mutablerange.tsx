 * This test fixture is similar to mutation-within-jsx. The only difference

 * mutated after its memo block through mutating `y`.
 *
 * While this is technically correct (as `z` is a nested memo block), it
 * is an edge case as we believe that values are not mutated after their
 * memo blocks (which may lead to 'tearing', i.e. mutating one render's
 * values in a subsequent render.
