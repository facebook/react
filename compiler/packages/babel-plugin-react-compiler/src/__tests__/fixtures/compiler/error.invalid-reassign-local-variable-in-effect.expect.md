```javascript
import {useEffect} from 'react';

function Component() {
  let local;

  const reassignLocal = newValue => {
    local = newValue;
  };

  const onMount = newValue => {
    reassignLocal('hello');

    if (local === newValue) {
      // Without React Compiler, `reassignLocal` is freshly created
      // on each render, capturing a binding to the latest `local`,
      // such that invoking reassignLocal will reassign the same
      // binding that we are observing in the if condition, and
      // we reach this branch
      console.log('`local` was updated!');
    } else {
      // With React Compiler enabled, `reassignLocal` is only created
      // once, capturing a binding to `local` in that render pass.
      // Therefore, calling `reassignLocal` will reassign the wrong
      // version of `local`, and not update the binding we are checking
      // in the if condition.
      //
      // To protect against this, we disallow reassigning locals from
      // functions that escape
      throw new Error('`local` not updated!');
    }
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    onMount();
  }, [onMount]);

## Error

Found 1 error:

Error: Cannot reassign variable after render completes

Reassigning `local` after render has completed can cause inconsistent behavior on subsequent renders. Consider using state instead.
