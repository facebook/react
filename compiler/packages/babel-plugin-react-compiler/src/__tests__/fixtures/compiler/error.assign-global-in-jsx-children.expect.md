## Input

```javascript
function Component() {
  const foo = () => {
    someGlobal = true;
  };
  // Children are generally access/called during render, so
  // modifying a global in a children function is almost
  // certainly a mistake.
  return <Foo>{foo}</Foo>;
}

```


## Error

```
Found 1 error:

Error: Cannot reassign variables declared outside of the component/hook

Variable `someGlobal` is declared outside of the component/hook. Reassigning this value during render is a form of side effect, which can cause unpredictable behavior depending on when the component happens to re-render. If this variable is used in rendering, use useState instead. Otherwise, consider updating it in an effect.
