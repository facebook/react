/**
 * This hook returns a function that when called with an input object,
 * will return the result of mapping that input with the supplied map
 * function. Results are cached, so if the same input is passed again,
 * the same output object will be returned.
 *
 * Note that this technically violates the rules of React and is unsafe:
 * hooks must return immutable objects and be pure, and a function which
 * captures and mutates a value when called is inherently not pure.
 *
 * However, in this case it is technically safe _if_ the mapping function
 * is pure *and* the resulting objects are never modified. This is because
 * the function only caches: the result of `returnedFunction(someInput)`
 * strictly depends on `returnedFunction` and `someInput`, and cannot
 * otherwise change over time.
