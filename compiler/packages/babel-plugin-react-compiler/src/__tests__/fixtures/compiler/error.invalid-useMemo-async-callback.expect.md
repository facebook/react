## Error

Found 3 errors:

Error: useMemo() callbacks may not be async or generator functions

useMemo() callbacks are called once and must synchronously return a value.

error.invalid-useMemo-async-callback.ts:2:18

Error: Found missing memoization dependencies

Missing dependencies can cause a value to update less often than it should, resulting in stale UI.

error.invalid-useMemo-async-callback.ts:3:10
  1 | function component(a, b) {
  2 |   let x = useMemo(async () => {
> 3 |     await a;
    |           ^ Missing dependency `a`
  4 |   }, []);
  5 |   return x;
  6 | }

Inferred dependencies: `[a]`

Compilation Skipped: Existing memoization could not be preserved

React Compiler has skipped optimizing this component because the existing manual memoization could not be preserved. The inferred dependencies did not match the manually specified dependencies, which could cause the value to change more or less frequently than expected. The inferred dependency was `a`, but the source dependencies were []. Inferred dependency not present in source.
