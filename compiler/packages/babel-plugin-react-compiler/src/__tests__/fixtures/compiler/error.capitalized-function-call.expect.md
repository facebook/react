Found 1 error:

Error: Capitalized functions are reserved for components, which must be invoked with JSX. If this is a component, render it with JSX. Otherwise, ensure that it has no hook calls and rename it to begin with a lowercase letter. Alternatively, if you know for a fact that this function is not a component, you can allowlist it via the compiler config

SomeFunc may be a component..
