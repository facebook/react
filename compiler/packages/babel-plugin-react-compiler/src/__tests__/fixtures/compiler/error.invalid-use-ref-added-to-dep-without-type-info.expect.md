## Input

```javascript
// @validateRefAccessDuringRender
function Foo({a}) {
  const ref = useRef();
  // type information is lost here as we don't track types of fields
  const val = {ref};
  // without type info, we don't know that val.ref.current is a ref value so we
  // *would* end up depending on val.ref.current
  // however, this is an instance of accessing a ref during render and is disallowed
  // under React's rules, so we reject this input
  const x = {a, val: val.ref.current};

  return <VideoList videos={x} />;
}

```

Error: Cannot access refs during render

React refs are values that are not needed for rendering. Refs should only be accessed outside of render, such as in event handlers or effects. Accessing a ref value (the `current` property) during render can cause your component not to update as expected (https://react.dev/reference/react/useRef)
