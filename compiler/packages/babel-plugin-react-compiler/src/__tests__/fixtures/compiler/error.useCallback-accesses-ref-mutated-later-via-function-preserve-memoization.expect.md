## Input

```javascript
// @enablePreserveExistingMemoizationGuarantees @validateRefAccessDuringRender
import {useCallback, useRef} from 'react';

function Component(props) {
  const ref = useRef({inner: null});

  const onChange = useCallback(event => {
    // The ref should still be mutable here even though function deps are frozen in
    // @enablePreserveExistingMemoizationGuarantees mode
    ref.current.inner = event.target.value;
  });

  // The ref is modified later, extending its range and preventing memoization of onChange
  const reset = () => {
    ref.current.inner = null;
  };
  reset();

  return <input onChange={onChange} />;
}

export const FIXTURE_ENTRYPOINT = {
  fn: Component,
  params: [{}],
};

## Error

```
Found 1 error:

Error: Mutating refs during render is not allowed

React refs are mutable containers that should only be mutated outside of render, such as in event handlers or effects. Mutating a ref during render can cause bugs because the mutation may not be associated with a particular render. See https://react.dev/reference/react/useRef.
