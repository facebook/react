/**
 * Libraries developed before we officially documented the [Rules of React](https://react.dev/reference/rules)
 * implement APIs which cannot be memoized safely, either via manual or automatic memoization.
 *
 * Any non-hook API that is designed to be called during render (not events/effects) should be safe to memoize:
 *
 * ```js
 * function Component() {
 *   const {someFunction} = useLibrary();
 *   // it should always be safe to memoize functions like this
 *  const result = useMemo(() => someFunction(), [someFunction]);
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * However, some APIs implement "interior mutability" â€” mutating values rather than copying into a new value
 * and setting state with the new value. Such functions (`someFunction()` in the example) could return different
 * values even though the function itself is the same object. This breaks memoization, since React relies on
 * the outer object (or function) changing if part of its value has changed.
 *
 * Given that we didn't have the Rules of React precisely documented prior to the introduction of React compiler,
 * it's understandable that some libraries accidentally shipped APIs that break this rule. However, developers
 * can easily run into pitfalls with these APIs. They may manually memoize them, which can break their app. Or
 * they may try using React Compiler, and think that the compiler has broken their code.
 *
 * To help ensure that developers can successfully use the compiler with existing code, this file teaches the
 * compiler about specific APIs that are known to be incompatible with memoization. We've tried to be as precise
 * as possible.
 *
 * The React team is open to collaborating with library authors to help develop compatible versions of these APIs,
 * and we have already reached out to the teams who own any API listed here to ensure they are aware of the issue.
