/*
 * Pass to eliminate redundant phi nodes:
 * - all operands are the same identifier, ie `x2 = phi(x1, x1, x1)`.
 * - all operands are the same identifier *or* the output of the phi, ie `x2 = phi(x1, x2, x1, x2)`.
 *
 * In both these cases, the phi is eliminated and all usages of the phi identifier
 * are replaced with the other operand (ie in both cases above, all usages of `x2` are replaced with `x1` .
 *
 * The algorithm is inspired by that in https://pp.ipd.kit.edu/uploads/publikationen/braun13cc.pdf
 * but modified to reduce passes over the CFG. We visit the blocks in reverse postorder. Each time a redundant
 * phi is encountered we add a mapping (eg x2 -> x1) to a rewrite table. Subsequent instructions, terminals,
 * and phis rewrite all their identifiers based on this table. The algorithm loops over the CFG repeatedly
 * until there are no new rewrites: for a CFG without back-edges it completes in a single pass.
