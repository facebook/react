# React Compiler Playground

An interactive playground to demonstrate, test, and have fun with React Compiler.

## Setup

```sh
# Build React Compiler from source and install Playground dependencies.
$ yarn

# Or similarly
$ npm install
```

## Development

```sh
# Start the local development server with
$ yarn dev

# Or
$ npm run dev

# Rerun the following (in a separate terminal window) when React Compiler
# is changed locally to keep Playground in sync.
$ yarn
```

## Deployment

This project has been deployed using Vercel. Vercel does the exact same thing as we would
locally, by running `yarn` at the install step in the Playground directory to build
React Compiler from source and [symlink](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/link) it as its dependency.
This means that Playground is automatically deployed on every push and pull requests will reflect
the behaviors of React Compiler of that commit.
