# Compiler Commit

Verify and commit compiler changes with the correct convention.

Arguments:
- $ARGUMENTS: Commit title (required). Optionally a test pattern after `--` (e.g., `Fix aliasing bug -- aliasing`)

## Instructions

1. **Run `/compiler-verify`** first (with test pattern if provided after `--`). Stop on any failure.

2. **Run `/compiler-review`** on the uncommitted changes. Report the findings to the user. If any issues are found, stop and do NOT commit — let the user decide how to proceed.

3. **Detect commit prefix** from changed files:
   - If any files in `compiler/crates/` changed: use `[rust-compiler]`
   - Otherwise: use `[compiler]`

4. **Update orchestrator log**: If `compiler/docs/rust-port/rust-port-orchestrator-log.md` exists and the commit includes Rust changes (`compiler/crates/`):

   Launch a `general-purpose` subagent to collect test data. The subagent should:
   - Read `compiler/crates/react_compiler/src/entrypoint/pipeline.rs` to find all ported passes (those with `log_debug!` calls)
   - Run `bash compiler/scripts/test-rust-port.sh <PassName>` for each ported pass to get pass/total counts
   - Return a structured summary:
     ```
     TEST RESULTS
     ============
     - #<num> <PassName>: <passed>/<total>
     - #<num> <PassName>: <passed>/<total>
     ...
     ```

   After the subagent returns:
   - Update the `# Status` section: set each pass to `complete (N/N)`, `partial (passed/total)`, or `todo` based on the results
   - Add a `## YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS` log entry noting the commit and what changed

5. **Stage files** — stage only the relevant changed files by name (including the orchestrator log if updated in step 4). Do NOT use `git add -A` or `git add .`.

6. **Compose commit message**:
   ```
   [prefix] <title>

   <summary of what changed and why, 1-3 sentences>
   ```
   The title comes from $ARGUMENTS. Write the summary yourself based on the actual changes.

7. **Commit** using a heredoc for the message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
   [rust-compiler] Title here

   Summary here.
   EOF
   )"
   ```

8. **Do NOT push** unless the user explicitly asks.

## Examples

- `/compiler-commit Fix aliasing bug in optional chains` — runs full verify, commits as `[compiler] Fix aliasing bug in optional chains`
- `/compiler-commit Implement scope tree types -- round_trip` — runs verify with `-p round_trip`, commits as `[rust-compiler] Implement scope tree types`
