# Compiler Commit

Verify and commit compiler changes with the correct convention.

Arguments:
- $ARGUMENTS: Commit title (required). Optionally a test pattern after `--` (e.g., `Fix aliasing bug -- aliasing`)

## Instructions

1. **Run `/compiler-verify`** first (with test pattern if provided after `--`). Stop on any failure.

2. **Detect commit prefix** from changed files:
   - If any files in `compiler/crates/` changed: use `[rust-compiler]`
   - Otherwise: use `[compiler]`

3. **Stage files** — stage only the relevant changed files by name. Do NOT use `git add -A` or `git add .`.

4. **Compose commit message**:
   ```
   [prefix] <title>

   <summary of what changed and why, 1-3 sentences>
   ```
   The title comes from $ARGUMENTS. Write the summary yourself based on the actual changes.

5. **Commit** using a heredoc for the message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
   [rust-compiler] Title here

   Summary here.
   EOF
   )"
   ```

6. **Do NOT push** unless the user explicitly asks.

## Examples

- `/compiler-commit Fix aliasing bug in optional chains` — runs full verify, commits as `[compiler] Fix aliasing bug in optional chains`
- `/compiler-commit Implement scope tree types -- round_trip` — runs verify with `-p round_trip`, commits as `[rust-compiler] Implement scope tree types`
