The error code system substitutes React's error messages with error IDs to
provide a better debugging support in production. Check out the blog post
[here](https://reactjs.org/blog/2016/07/11/introducing-reacts-error-code-system.html).

- [`codes.json`](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/main/scripts/error-codes/codes.json)
  contains the mapping from IDs to error messages. This file is generated by the
  Gulp plugin and is used by both the Babel plugin and the error decoder page in
  our documentation. This file is append-only, which means an existing code in
  the file will never be changed/removed.
- [`extract-errors.js`](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/main/scripts/error-codes/extract-errors.js)
  is a node script that traverses our codebase and updates `codes.json`. You
  can test it by running `yarn extract-errors`. It works by crawling the build
  artifacts directory, so you need to have either run the build script or
  downloaded pre-built artifacts (e.g. with `yarn download build`). It works
  with partial builds, too.
- [`transform-error-messages`](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/main/scripts/error-codes/transform-error-messages.js)
  is a Babel pass that rewrites error messages to IDs for a production
  (minified) build.
