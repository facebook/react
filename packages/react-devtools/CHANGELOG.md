### 4.22.0
December 13, 2021

#### A note for React Native users
React DevTools has [two main pieces](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/main/packages/react-devtools/OVERVIEW.md#overview):
* The *frontend* users interact with (the Components tree, the Profiler, etc.).
* The *backend* which runs in the same context as React itself. (In the web page with React DOM or shipped on the device with the React Native runtime.)

This release updates the [**protocol** that DevTools uses](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/main/packages/react-devtools/OVERVIEW.md#serializing-the-tree) to communicate between the "frontend" and "backend" components.

Because React Native embeds a copy of the React DevTools "backend" ([`react-devtools-core/backend`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-devtools-core)), the "frontend" (UI) needs to match. This means you may be prompted to upgrade (or downgrade) your React DevTools based on which version of React Native your app uses.

#### Features
* Support multiple DevTools instances per page ([@bvaughn](https://github.com/bvaughn) in [#22949](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/22949))

* Timeline: Improved snapshot view ([@bvaughn](https://github.com/bvaughn) in [#22706](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/22706))
* Display root type for root updates in "what caused this update?" ([@eps1lon](https://github.com/eps1lon) in [#22599](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/22599))

#### Bugfix
* DevTools should inject itself for XHTML pages too (not just HTML) ([@bvaughn](https://github.com/bvaughn) in [#22932](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/22932))
* Don't restore profiling data if we're profling ([@eps1lon](https://github.com/eps1lon) in [#22753](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/22753))

##### Scheduling profiler

###### What is React working on?

React’s previous Profiler primarily reports how fast (or slow) components are when rendering. It didn’t provide an overview of *what React is doing* (the actual cooperative scheduling bits). The new profiler does. It shows when components schedule state updates and when React works on them. It also shows how React categorizes and prioritizing what it works on.

Here’s a profile for a simple app that uses only the legacy (synchronous) `ReactDOM.render` API. The profiler shows that all of the work scheduled and rendered by this app is done at *synchronous* priority:

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29597/129042321-56985f5a-264e-4f3a-a8b7-9371d75c690f.mp4

Here’s a more interesting profile for an app that’s rendered at _default_ priority using the new [`createRoot` API](https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/5), then updates _synchronously_ in response to an “input” event to manage a ["controlled component"](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components):

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29597/129074959-50912a63-0215-4be5-b51b-1e0004fcd2a1.mp4

Here’s part of a profile showing an idle app (no JavaScript running). In this case, React does some pre-rendering work for components that are “offscreen” (not currently displayed).

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29597/128971757-612f232f-c64f-4447-a766-66a0516e8f49.mp4

Note that “offscreen” refers to a new API and set of features that we haven’t talked about much yet except for [some passing references](https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/18#discussioncomment-795661). We’ll talk more about it in future posts.

###### What are “transitions” and how do they work?
We recently shared an update about the new [`startTransition` API](https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/41). This API helps apps feel responsive even when there are large updates by splitting the work into (1) a quick update to show that the app has received some input and (2) a slower update (the “transition”) that actually does any heavy lifting needed as a result of the input.

Here is an example profile that uses the transition API. First React renders a small update that shows the user some visual feedback (like updating a controlled component or showing an inline loading indicator). Then it renders a larger update that, in this case, computes some expensive value.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29597/129079176-0995c8c0-e95a-4f44-8d55-891a7efa35c0.mp4

###### How does Suspense impact rendering performance?

You may have heard mention of “suspense” in past talks or seen it referenced [in our docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#suspense). Although full support for data fetching via Suspense is [expected to be released sometime after React 18.0](https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/47#discussioncomment-847004), you can use Suspense today for things like lazy-loading React components. The new profiler shows when components suspend during render and how that impacts overall rendering performance.

Here’s an example profile that suspends during the initial render to lazy-load a component using [`React.lazy`](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html#reactlazy). While this component is loading, React shows a “fallback“ (placeholder UI). Once the component finishes loading, React retries the render and commits the final UI.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29597/129054366-2700e7e8-0172-4f61-9453-475acd740456.mp4

We plan to expand support for Suspense in the coming weeks to more explicitly show when suspense fallbacks are rendered and which subsequent renders are related to an initial update that suspended.

###### What else might cause a render to get delayed?

Suspense can cause a render to get delayed as React waits for data to load, but React can also get stuck waiting on a lot of JavaScript to run.

React profiling tools have previously focused on only reporting what React (or React components) are doing, but any JavaScript the browser runs affects performance. The new profiler shows non-React JavaScript as well, making it easy to see when it delays React from rendering.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29597/128971952-7c4e7e11-f4fb-497e-b643-4d9b3994b590.mp4

###### What can you do to improve performance?

Until now, DevTools (and the Profiler) has provided information without commentary. The new profiler takes a more active approach– highlighting where we think performance can be improved and providing suggestions.

For example, suspending during an update is generally a bad user experience because it causes previously shown components to be unmounted (hidden) so the fallback can be shown while data loads. This can be avoided using the new [Transition API](https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/41). If you forget to add a transition to an update that suspends, the new profiler will warn you about this:

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29597/128972228-3b23f01a-8017-43ad-b371-975ffed26c06.mp4

The new profiler also warns about scheduling a long, synchronous React update inside of event handler.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29597/128972000-d7477ba3-b779-46f2-b141-aaa712e9d6d2.mp4

Another thing the new profiler will warn about is long-running renders scheduled from layout effects (`useLayoutEffect` or `componentDidMount`/`componentDidUpdate`). These updates (called “nested updates”) are sometimes necessary to adjust layout before the browser paints, but they should be *fast*. Slow nested updates make the browser feel unresponsive.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29597/128972017-3ed0e682-751c-46fb-a6c5-271f255c8087.mp4

August 15, 2019

---

### General changes

#### Improved performance
The legacy DevTools extension used to add significant performance overhead, making it unusable for some larger React applications. That overhead has been effectively eliminated in version 4.

[Learn more](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/main/packages/react-devtools/OVERVIEW.md) about the performance optimizations that made this possible.

#### Component stacks

React component authors have often requested a way to log warnings that include the React ["component stack"](https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html#component-stack-traces). DevTools now provides an option to automatically append this information to warnings (`console.warn`) and errors (`console.error`).

![Example console warning with component stack added](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29597/62228120-eec3da80-b371-11e9-81bb-018c1e577389.png)

It can be disabled in the general settings panel:

![Settings panel showing "component stacks" option](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29597/62227882-8f65ca80-b371-11e9-8a4e-5d27011ad1aa.png)

---

### Components tree changes

#### Component filters

Large component trees can sometimes be hard to navigate. DevTools now provides a way to filter components so that you can hide ones you're not interested in seeing.

![Component filter demo video](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29597/62229209-0bf9a880-b374-11e9-8f84-cebd6c1a016b.gif)

Host nodes (e.g. HTML `<div>`, React Native `View`) are now hidden by default, but you can see them by disabling that filter.

Filter preferences are remembered between sessions.

#### No more inline props

Components in the tree no longer show inline props. This was done to [make DevTools faster](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/main/packages/react-devtools/OVERVIEW.md) and to make it easier to browse larger component trees.

You can view a component's props, state, and hooks by selecting it:

![Inspecting props](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29597/62303001-37da6400-b430-11e9-87fd-10a94df88efa.png)

#### "Rendered by" list

In React, an element's "owner" refers to the thing that rendered it. Sometimes an element's parent is also its owner, but usually they're different. This distinction is important because props come from owners.

![Example code](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29597/62229551-bbcf1600-b374-11e9-8411-8ff411f4f847.png)

When you are debugging an unexpected prop value, you can save time if you skip over the parents.

DevTools v4 adds a new "rendered by" list in the right hand pane that allows you to quickly step through the list of owners to speed up your debugging.

![Example video showing the "rendered by" list](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29597/62229747-4152c600-b375-11e9-9930-3f6b3b92be7a.gif)

#### Owners tree

The inverse of the "rendered by" list is called the "owners tree". It is the list of things rendered by a particular component- (the things it "owns"). This view is kind of like looking at the source of the component's render method, and can be a helpful way to explore large, unfamiliar React applications.

Double click a component to view the owners tree and click the "x" button to return to the full component tree:

![Demo showing "owners tree" feature](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29597/62229452-84f90000-b374-11e9-818a-61eec6be0bb4.gif)

#### No more horizontal scrolling

Deeply nested components used to require both vertical and horizontal scrolling to see, making it easy to "get lost" within large component trees. DevTools now dynamically adjusts nesting indentation to eliminate horizontal scrolling.

![Video demonstration dynamic indentation to eliminate horizontal scrolling](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29597/62246661-f8ad0400-b398-11e9-885f-284f150a6d76.gif)

#### Improved hooks support

Hooks now have the same level of support as props and state: values can be edited, arrays and objects can be drilled into, etc.

![Video demonstrating hooks support](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29597/62230532-d86c4d80-b376-11e9-8629-1b2129b210d6.gif)

#### Improved search UX

Legacy DevTools search filtered the components tree to show matching nodes as roots. This made the overall structure of the application harder to reason about, because it displayed ancestors as siblings.

Search results are now shown inline similar to the browser's find-in-page search.

#### Higher order components

[Higher order components](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html) (or HOCs) often provide a [custom `displayName`](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html#convention-wrap-the-display-name-for-easy-debugging) following a convention of `withHOC(InnerComponentName)` in order to make it easier to identify components in React warnings and in DevTools.

The new Components tree formats these HOC names (along with several built-in utilities like `React.memo` and `React.forwardRef`) as a special badge to the right of the decorated component name.

Components decorated with multiple HOCs show the topmost badge and a count. Selecting the component shows all of the HOCs badges in the properties panel.

#### Restoring selection between reloads

DevTools now attempts to restore the previously selected element when you reload the page.

#### Suspense toggle

React's experimental [Suspense API](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#suspense) lets components "wait" for something before rendering. `<Suspense>` components can be used to specify loading states when components deeper in the tree are waiting to render.

DevTools lets you test these loading states with a new toggle:

### Profiler changes

#### Reload and profile

The profiler is a powerful tool for performance tuning React components. Legacy DevTools supported profiling, but only after it detected a profiling-capable version of React. Because of this there was no way to profile the initial _mount_ (one of the most performance sensitive parts) of an application.

This feature is now supported with a "reload and profile" action:

#### Import/export

Profiler data can now be exported and shared with other developers to enable easier collaboration.

Exports include all commits, timings, interactions, etc.

#### "Why did this render?"

"Why did this render?" is a common question when profiling. The profiler now helps answer this question by recording which props and state change between renders.

Because this feature adds a small amount of overhead, it can be disabled in the profiler settings panel.

#### Component renders list

The profiler now displays a list of each time the selected component rendered during a profiling session, along with the duration of each render. This list can be used to quickly jump between commits when analyzing the performance of a specific component.
