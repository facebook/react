/**
 * Summary of `ReactBrowserEventEmitter` event handling:
 *
 *  - Top-level delegation is used to trap most native browser events. This
 *    may only occur in the main thread and is the responsibility of
 *    ReactDOMEventListener, which is injected and can therefore support
 *    pluggable event sources. This is the only work that occurs in the main
 *    thread.
 *
 *  - We normalize and de-duplicate events to account for browser quirks. This
 *    may be done in the worker thread.
 *
 *  - Forward these native events (with the associated top-level type used to
 *    trap it) to `EventPluginHub`, which in turn will ask plugins if they want
 *    to extract any synthetic events.
 *
 *  - The `EventPluginHub` will then process each event by annotating them with
 *    "dispatches", a sequence of listeners and IDs that care about that event.
 *
 *  - The `EventPluginHub` then dispatches the events.

/**
 * We listen for bubbled touch events on the document object.
 *
 * Firefox v8.01 (and possibly others) exhibited strange behavior when
 * mounting `onmousemove` events at some node that was not the document
 * element. The symptoms were that if your mouse is not moving over something
 * contained within that mount point (for example on the background) the
 * top-level listeners for `onmousemove` won't be called. However, if you
 * register the `mousemove` on the document object, then it will of course
 * catch all `mousemove`s. This along with iOS quirks, justifies restricting
 * top-level listeners to the document object only, at least for these
 * movement types of events and possibly all events.
 *
 * @see http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2010/09/click_event_del.html
 *
 * Also, `keyup`/`keypress`/`keydown` do not bubble to the window on IE, but
 * they bubble to document.
 *
 * @param {string} registrationName Name of listener (e.g. `onClick`).
 * @param {object} mountAt Container where to mount the listener
