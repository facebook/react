// It exists as a placeholder so that DevTools can support work tag changes between releases.
// When we next publish a release, update the matching TODO in backend/renderer.js
// TODO: This module is used both by the release scripts and to expose a version
// at runtime. We should instead inject the version number as part of the build
// process, and use the ReactVersions.js module as the single source of truth.
