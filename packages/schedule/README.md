# `schedule`

This is a package for cooperative scheduling in a browser environment. It is currently used internally by React, but we plan to make it more generic.

The public API for this package is not yet finalized.

### Thanks

The React team thanks [Haoliang Gao](https://github.com/popomore) for donating the `schedule` package name.
