# `eslint-plugin-react-hooks`

This ESLint plugin enforces the [Rules of Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html).

It is a part of the [Hooks API](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) for React.

## Installation

**Note: If you're using Create React App, please use `react-scripts` >= 3 instead of adding it directly.**

Assuming you already have ESLint installed, run:

```sh
# npm
npm install eslint-plugin-react-hooks --save-dev

# yarn
yarn add eslint-plugin-react-hooks --dev
```

Then add it to your ESLint configuration:

```js
{
  "plugins": [
    // ...
    "react-hooks"
  ],
  "rules": {
    // ...
    "react-hooks/rules-of-hooks": "error",
    "react-hooks/exhaustive-deps": "warn"
  }
}
```

Or use the recommended config:

```js
{
  "extends": [
    // ...
    "plugin:react-hooks/recommended"
  ]
}
```
