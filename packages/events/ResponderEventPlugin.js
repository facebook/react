/**
 *
 * Responder System:
 * ----------------
 *
 * - A global, solitary "interaction lock" on a view.
 * - If a node becomes the responder, it should convey visual feedback
 *   immediately to indicate so, either by highlighting or moving accordingly.
 * - To be the responder means, that touches are exclusively important to that
 *   responder view, and no other view.
 * - While touches are still occurring, the responder lock can be transferred to
 *   a new view, but only to increasingly "higher" views (meaning ancestors of
 *   the current responder).
 *
 * Responder being granted:
 * ------------------------
 *
 * - Touch starts, moves, and scrolls can cause an ID to become the responder.
 * - We capture/bubble `startShouldSetResponder`/`moveShouldSetResponder` to
 *   the "appropriate place".
 * - If nothing is currently the responder, the "appropriate place" is the
 *   initiating event's `targetID`.
 * - If something *is* already the responder, the "appropriate place" is the
 *   first common ancestor of the event target and the current `responderInst`.
 * - Some negotiation happens: See the timing diagram below.
 * - Scrolled views automatically become responder. The reasoning is that a
 *   platform scroll view that isn't built on top of the responder system has
 *   began scrolling, and the active responder must now be notified that the
 *   interaction is no longer locked to it - the system has taken over.
 *
 * - Responder being released:
 *   As soon as no more touches that *started* inside of descendants of the
 *   *current* responderInst, an `onResponderRelease` event is dispatched to the
 *   current responder, and the responder lock is released.
 *
 * TODO:
 * - on "end", a callback hook for `onResponderEndShouldRemainResponder` that
 *   determines if the responder lock should remain.
 * - If a view shouldn't "remain" the responder, any active touches should by
 *   default be considered "dead" and do not influence future negotiations or
 *   bubble paths. It should be as if those touches do not exist.
 * -- For multitouch: Usually a translate-z will choose to "remain" responder
 *  after one out of many touches ended. For translate-y, usually the view
 *  doesn't wish to "remain" responder after one of many touches end.
 * - Consider building this on top of a `stopPropagation` model similar to
 *   `W3C` events.
 * - Ensure that `onResponderTerminate` is called on touch cancels, whether or
 *   not `onResponderTerminationRequest` returns `true` or `false`.

/**
 * A note about event ordering in the `EventPluginHub`.
 *
 * Suppose plugins are injected in the following order:
 *
 * `[R, S, C]`
 *
 * To help illustrate the example, assume `S` is `SimpleEventPlugin` (for
 * `onClick` etc) and `R` is `ResponderEventPlugin`.
 *
 * "Deferred-Dispatched Events":
 *
 * - The current event plugin system will traverse the list of injected plugins,
 *   in order, and extract events by collecting the plugin's return value of
 *   `extractEvents()`.
 * - These events that are returned from `extractEvents` are "deferred
 *   dispatched events".
 * - When returned from `extractEvents`, deferred-dispatched events contain an
 *   "accumulation" of deferred dispatches.
 * - These deferred dispatches are accumulated/collected before they are
 *   returned, but processed at a later time by the `EventPluginHub` (hence the
 *   name deferred).
 *
 * In the process of returning their deferred-dispatched events, event plugins
 * themselves can dispatch events on-demand without returning them from
 * `extractEvents`. Plugins might want to do this, so that they can use event
 * dispatching as a tool that helps them decide which events should be extracted
 * in the first place.
 *
 * "On-Demand-Dispatched Events":
 *
 * - On-demand-dispatched events are not returned from `extractEvents`.
 * - On-demand-dispatched events are dispatched during the process of returning
 *   the deferred-dispatched events.
 * - They should not have side effects.
 * - They should be avoided, and/or eventually be replaced with another
 *   abstraction that allows event plugins to perform multiple "rounds" of event
 *   extraction.
 *
 * Therefore, the sequence of event dispatches becomes:
 *
 * - `R`s on-demand events (if any)   (dispatched by `R` on-demand)
 * - `S`s on-demand events (if any)   (dispatched by `S` on-demand)
 * - `C`s on-demand events (if any)   (dispatched by `C` on-demand)
 * - `R`s extracted events (if any)   (dispatched by `EventPluginHub`)
 * - `S`s extracted events (if any)   (dispatched by `EventPluginHub`)
 * - `C`s extracted events (if any)   (dispatched by `EventPluginHub`)
 *
 * In the case of `ResponderEventPlugin`: If the `startShouldSetResponder`
 * on-demand dispatch returns `true` (and some other details are satisfied) the
 * `onResponderGrant` deferred dispatched event is returned from
 * `extractEvents`. The sequence of dispatch executions in this case
 * will appear as follows:
 *
 * - `startShouldSetResponder` (`ResponderEventPlugin` dispatches on-demand)
 * - `touchStartCapture`       (`EventPluginHub` dispatches as usual)
 * - `touchStart`              (`EventPluginHub` dispatches as usual)
 * - `responderGrant/Reject`   (`EventPluginHub` dispatches as usual)
