export default defineNuxtConfig({
  routeRules: {
    // Use client-side rendering for all routes
    '/**': { ssr: false },
  },
});

Setting ssr: false for routes will cause them to deploy with client-side rendering.

To deploy a static site, build your project with nuxt generate.

To summarize, SSR with Nuxt on Vercel:

Scales to zero when not in use
Scales automatically with traffic increases
Allows you to opt individual routes out of SSR
