<div class="post">
  <p>Building a better developer experience has been one of the things that React deeply cares about, and a crucial part of it is to detect anti-patterns/potential errors early and provide helpful error messages when things (may) go wrong. However, most of these only exist in development mode; in production, we avoid having extra expensive assertions and sending down full error messages in order to reduce the number of bytes sent over the wire.</p>

<p>Prior to this release, we stripped out error messages at build-time and this is why you might have seen this message in production:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Minified exception occurred; use the non-minified dev environment for the full error message and additional helpful warnings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In order to make debugging in production easier, we&#39;re introducing an Error Code System in <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/releases/tag/v15.2.0">15.2.0</a>. We developed a <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/scripts/error-codes/gulp-extract-errors.js">gulp script</a> that collects all of our <code>invariant</code> error messages and folds them to a <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/scripts/error-codes/codes.json">JSON file</a>, and at build-time Babel uses the JSON to <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/scripts/error-codes/dev-expression-with-codes.js">rewrite</a> our <code>invariant</code> calls in production to reference the corresponding error IDs. Now when things go wrong in production, the error that React throws will contain a URL with an error ID and relevant information. The URL will point you to a page in our documentation where the original error message gets reassembled.</p>

<p>While we hope you don&#39;t see errors often, you can see how it works <a href="/react/docs/error-decoder.html?invariant=109&amp;args%5B%5D=Foo">here</a>. This is what the same error from above will look like:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Minified React error #109; visit https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/error-decoder.html?invariant=109&amp;args[]=Foo for the full message or use the non-minified dev environment for full errors and additional helpful warnings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We do this so that the developer experience is as good as possible, while also keeping the production bundle size as small as possible. This feature shouldn&#39;t require any changes on your side — use the <code>min.js</code> files in production or bundle your application code with <code>process.env.NODE_ENV === &#39;production&#39;</code> and you should be good to go!</p>

<div class="post">
  <p>Yesterday afternoon we shipped v15.0.0 and quickly got some feedback about a couple of issues. We apologize for these problems and we&#39;ve been working since then to make sure we get fixes into your hands as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>The first of these issues is related to the removal of an undocumented API. This API was added to enable <a href="/react/docs/jsx-spread.html">JSX Spread Attributes</a> in our JS compile tools (react-tools, JSXTransformer) before <code>Object.assign</code> was standard. When we stopped supporting these tools last year, we kept the API there to catch the longer tail of people using those tools. Meanwhile we moved to using Babel and encouraged others to do the same. Babel will typically compile the spread use to an <code>_extends</code> helper, which will use <code>Object.assign</code>. We did not properly research other compilation tools before deciding to remove the API in v15. Specifically, TypeScript and coffee-react are two popular packages using <code>React.__spread</code>, as well as reactify which still makes use react-tools. In order to make sure that code compiled with these tools is not broken, we will be restoring the <code>React.__spread</code> API and adding a warning. It will be removed in the future so if you maintain a project making using of it, we encourage you to compile to <code>Object.assign</code> directly or a similar helper function.</p>

<p>The second issue resulted in cursor position being lost in controlled inputs. We merged a pull request earlier this week to fix a separate regression from v0.14. Our goal was to target <code>&lt;option&gt;</code> elements but we ended up targeting all interactions with <code>value</code> properties. Unfortunately we didn&#39;t test it as thoroughly as we thought. We backed out the offending change and fixed the issue in different way which doesn&#39;t have the same problem.</p>

<p>We apologize if you installed 15.0.0 and have encountered these issues yourselves.</p>

<p>As usual, you can get install the <code>react</code> package via npm or download a browser bundle.</p>

<div class="post">
  <p>We would like to thank the React community for reporting issues and regressions in the release candidates on our <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/">issue tracker</a>. Over the last few weeks we fixed those issues, and now, after two release candidates, we are excited to finally release the stable version of React 15.</p>

<p>As a reminder, <a href="/react/blog/2016/02/19/new-versioning-scheme.html">we’re switching to major versions</a> to indicate that we have been using React in production for a long time. This 15.0 release follows our previous 0.14 version and we’ll continue to follow semver like we’ve been doing since 2013. It’s also worth noting that <a href="/react/blog/2016/01/12/discontinuing-ie8-support.html">we no longer actively support Internet Explorer 8</a>. We believe React will work in its current form there but we will not be prioritizing any efforts to fix new issues that only affect IE8.</p>

<p>React 15 brings significant improvements to how we interact with the DOM:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We are now using <code>document.createElement</code> instead of setting <code>innerHTML</code> when mounting components. This allows us to get rid of the <code>data-reactid</code> attribute on every node and make the DOM lighter. Using <code>document.createElement</code> is also faster in modern browsers and fixes a number of edge cases related to SVG elements and running multiple copies of React on the same page.</p></li>
<li><p>Historically our support for SVG has been incomplete, and many tags and attributes were missing. We heard you, and in React 15 we <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/6243">added support for all the SVG attributes that are recognized by today’s browsers</a>. If we missed any of the attributes you’d like to use, please <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/1657">let us know</a>. As a bonus, thanks to using <code>document.createElement</code>, we no longer need to maintain a list of SVG tags, so any SVG tags that were previously unsupported should work just fine in React 15.</p></li>
<li><p>We received some amazing contributions from the community in this release, and we would like to highlight <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/5753">this pull request</a> by <a href="https://github.com/mwiencek">Michael Wiencek</a> in particular. Thanks to Michael’s work, React 15 no longer emits extra <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> nodes around the text, making the DOM output much cleaner. This was a longstanding annoyance for React users so it’s exciting to accept this as an outside contribution.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>While this isn’t directly related to the release, we understand that in order to receive more community contributions like Michael’s, we need to communicate our goals and priorities more openly, and review pull requests more decisively. As a first step towards this, we started publishing <a href="https://github.com/reactjs/core-notes">React core team weekly meeting notes</a> again. We also intend to introduce an RFC process inspired by <a href="https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs">Ember RFCs</a> so external contributors can have more insight and influence in the future development of React. We will keep you updated about this on our blog.</p>

<p>We are also experimenting with a new changelog format in this post. Every change now links to the corresponding pull request and mentions the author. Let us know whether you find this useful!</p>

<h2>Upgrade Guide</h2>

<p>As usual with major releases, React 15 will remove support for some of the patterns deprecated nine months ago in React 0.14. We know changes can be painful (the Facebook codebase has over 20,000 React components, and that’s not even counting React Native), so we always try to make changes gradually in order to minimize the pain.</p>

<p>If your code is free of warnings when running under React 0.14, upgrading should be easy. The bulk of changes in this release are actually behind the scenes, impacting the way that React interacts with the DOM. The other substantial change is that React now supports the full range of SVG elements and attributes. Beyond that we have a large number of incremental improvements and additional warnings aimed to aid developers. We’ve also laid some groundwork in the core to bring you some new capabilities in future releases.</p>

<p>See the changelog below for more details.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>We recommend using React from <code>npm</code> and using a tool like browserify or webpack to build your code into a single bundle. To install the two packages:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>npm install --save react react-dom</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Remember that by default, React runs extra checks and provides helpful warnings in development mode. When deploying your app, set the <code>NODE_ENV</code> environment variable to <code>production</code> to use the production build of React which does not include the development warnings and runs significantly faster.</p>

<p>If you can’t use <code>npm</code> yet, we provide pre-built browser builds for your convenience, which are also available in the <code>react</code> package on bower.</p>

<h2>Changelog</h2>

<h3>Major changes</h3>

<ul>
<li><h4><code>document.createElement</code> is in and <code>data-reactid</code> is out</h4>

<p>There were a number of large changes to our interactions with the DOM. One of the most noticeable changes is that we no longer set the <code>data-reactid</code> attribute for each DOM node. While this will make it more difficult to know if a website is using React, the advantage is that the DOM is much more lightweight. This change was made possible by us switching to use <code>document.createElement</code> on initial render. Previously we would generate a large string of HTML and then set <code>node.innerHTML</code>. At the time, this was decided to be faster than using <code>document.createElement</code> for the majority of cases and browsers that we supported. Browsers have continued to improve and so overwhelmingly this is no longer true. By using <code>createElement</code> we can make other parts of React faster. The ids were used to map back from events to the original React component, meaning we had to do a bunch of work on every event, even though we cached this data heavily. As we’ve all experienced, caching and in particularly invalidating caches, can be error prone and we saw many hard to reproduce issues over the years as a result. Now we can build up a direct mapping at render time since we already have a handle on the node.  </p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> <code>data-reactid</code> is still present for server-rendered content, however it is much smaller than before and is simply an auto-incrementing counter.  </p>

<p><small><a href="https://github.com/spicyj">@spicyj</a> in <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/5205">#5205</a></small></p></li>
<li><h4>No more extra <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>s</h4>

<p>Another big change with our DOM interaction is how we render text blocks. Previously you may have noticed that React rendered a lot of extra <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>s. For example, in our most basic example on the home page we render <code>&lt;div&gt;Hello {this.props.name}&lt;/div&gt;</code>, resulting in markup that contained 2 <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>s. Now we’ll render plain text nodes interspersed with comment nodes that are used for demarcation. This gives us the same ability to update individual pieces of text, without creating extra nested nodes. Very few people have depended on the actual markup generated here so it’s likely you are not impacted. However if you were targeting these <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>s in your CSS, you will need to adjust accordingly. You can always render them explicitly in your components.  </p>

<p><small><a href="https://github.com/mwiencek">@mwiencek</a> in <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/5753">#5753</a></small></p></li>
<li><h4>Rendering <code>null</code> now uses comment nodes</h4>

<p>We’ve also made use of these comment nodes to change what <code>null</code> renders to. Rendering to <code>null</code> was a feature we added in React 0.11 and was implemented by rendering <code>&lt;noscript&gt;</code> elements. By rendering to comment nodes now, there’s a chance some of your CSS will be targeting the wrong thing, specifically if you are making use of <code>:nth-child</code> selectors. React’s use of the <code>&lt;noscript&gt;</code> tag has always been considered an implementation detail of how React targets the DOM. We believe they are safe changes to make without going through a release with warnings detailing the subtle differences as they are details that should not be depended upon. Additionally, we have seen that these changes have improved React performance for many typical applications.  </p>

<p><small><a href="https://github.com/spicyj">@spicyj</a> in <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/5451">#5451</a></small></p></li>
<li><h4>Functional components can now return <code>null</code> too</h4>

<p>We added support for <a href="/react/blog/2015/09/10/react-v0.14-rc1.html#stateless-function-components">defining stateless components as functions</a> in React 0.14. However, React 0.14 still allowed you to define a class component without extending <code>React.Component</code> or using <code>React.createClass()</code>, so <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/5355">we couldn’t reliably tell if your component is a function or a class</a>, and did not allow returning <code>null</code> from it. This issue is solved in React 15, and you can now return <code>null</code> from any component, whether it is a class or a function.  </p>

<p><small><a href="https://github.com/jimfb">@jimfb</a> in <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/5884">#5884</a></small></p></li>
<li><h4>Improved SVG support</h4>

<p>All SVG tags are now fully supported. (Uncommon SVG tags are not present on the <code>React.DOM</code> element helper, but JSX and <code>React.createElement</code> work on all tag names.) All SVG attributes that are implemented by the browsers should be supported too. If you find any attributes that we have missed, please <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/1657">let us know in this issue</a>.  </p>

<p><small><a href="https://github.com/zpao">@zpao</a> in <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/6243">#6243</a></small></p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Breaking changes</h3>

<ul>
<li><h4>No more extra <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>s</h4>

<p>It’s worth calling out the DOM structure changes above again, in particular the change from <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>s. In the course of updating the Facebook codebase, we found a very small amount of code that was depending on the markup that React generated. Some of these cases were integration tests like WebDriver which were doing very specific XPath queries to target nodes. Others were simply tests using <code>ReactDOM.renderToStaticMarkup</code> and comparing markup. Again, there were a very small number of changes that had to be made, but we don’t want anybody to be blindsided. We encourage everybody to run their test suites when upgrading and consider alternative approaches when possible. One approach that will work for some cases is to explicitly use <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>s in your <code>render</code> method.  </p>

<p><small><a href="https://github.com/mwiencek">@mwiencek</a> in <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/5753">#5753</a></small></p></li>
<li><h4><code>React.cloneElement()</code> now resolves <code>defaultProps</code></h4>

<p>We fixed a bug in <code>React.cloneElement()</code> that some components may rely on. If some of the <code>props</code> received by <code>cloneElement()</code> are <code>undefined</code>, it used to return an element with <code>undefined</code> values for those props. In React 15, we’re changing it to be consistent with <code>createElement()</code>. Now any <code>undefined</code> props passed to <code>cloneElement()</code> are resolved to the corresponding component’s <code>defaultProps</code>. Only one of our 20,000 React components was negatively affected by this so we feel comfortable releasing this change without keeping the old behavior for another release cycle.  </p>

<p><small><a href="https://github.com/truongduy134">@truongduy134</a> in <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/5997">#5997</a></small></p></li>
<li><h4><code>ReactPerf.getLastMeasurements()</code> is opaque</h4>

<p>This change won’t affect applications but may break some third-party tools. We are <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/6046">revamping <code>ReactPerf</code> implementation</a> and plan to release it during the 15.x cycle. The internal performance measurement format is subject to change so, for the time being, we consider the return value of <code>ReactPerf.getLastMeasurements()</code> an opaque data structure that should not be relied upon.  </p>

<p><small><a href="https://github.com/gaearon">@gaearon</a> in <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/6286">#6286</a></small></p></li>
<li><h4>Removed deprecations</h4>

<p>These deprecations were introduced nine months ago in v0.14 with a warning and are removed:</p>

<ul>
<li>Deprecated APIs are removed from the <code>React</code> top-level export: <code>findDOMNode</code>, <code>render</code>, <code>renderToString</code>, <code>renderToStaticMarkup</code>, and <code>unmountComponentAtNode</code>.

<h3>New deprecations, introduced with a warning</h3>

<p>Each of these changes will continue to work as before with a new warning until the release of React 16 so you can upgrade your code gradually.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>LinkedStateMixin</code> and <code>valueLink</code> are now deprecated due to very low popularity. If you need this, you can use a wrapper component that implements the same behavior: <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-linked-input">react-linked-input</a>.<br>
<small><a href="https://github.com/jimfb">@jimfb</a> in <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/6127">#6127</a></small></p></li>
<li><p>Future versions of React will treat <code>&lt;input value={null}&gt;</code> as a request to clear the input. However, React 0.14 has been ignoring <code>value={null}</code>. React 15 warns you on a <code>null</code> input value and offers you to clarify your intention. To fix the warning, you may explicitly pass an empty string to clear a controlled input, or pass <code>undefined</code> to make the input uncontrolled.<br>
<small><a href="https://github.com/antoaravinth">@antoaravinth</a> in <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/5048">#5048</a></small></p></li>
<li><p><code>ReactPerf.printDOM()</code> was renamed to <code>ReactPerf.printOperations()</code>, and <code>ReactPerf.getMeasurementsSummaryMap()</code> was renamed to <code>ReactPerf.getWasted()</code>.<br>

  <p>We have already released two release candidates for React 15, and the final version is coming soon.</p>

<p>However <a href="https://github.com/iancmyers">Ian Christian Myers</a> discovered a memory leak related to server rendering in React 0.14 and <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/6060">contributed a fix</a>. While this memory leak has already been fixed in a different way in the React 15 release candidates, we decided to cut another 0.14 release that contains just this fix.</p>

<p>The release is now available for download:</p>

  <p>Today we&#39;re releasing a second release candidate for version 15. Primarily this is to address 2 issues, but we also picked up a few small changes from new contributors, including some improvements to some of our new warnings.</p>

<p>The most pressing change that was made is to fix a bug in our new code that removes <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>s, as discussed in the original RC1 post. Specifically we have some code that takes a different path in IE11 and Edge due to the speed of some DOM operations. There was a bug in this code which didn&#39;t break out of the optimization for <code>DocumentFragment</code>s, resulting in text not appearing at all. Thanks to the several people who <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/6246">reported this</a>.</p>

<p>The other change is to our SVG code. In RC1 we had made the decision to pass through all attributes directly. This led to <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/6211">some confusion with <code>class</code> vs <code>className</code></a> and ultimately led us to reconsider our position on the approach. Passing through all attributes meant that we would have two different patterns for using React where things like hyphenated attributes would work for SVG but not HTML. In the future, we <em>might</em> change our approach to the problem for HTML as well but in the meantime, maintaining consistency is important. So we reverted the changes that allowed the attributes to be passed through and instead expanded the SVG property list to include all attributes that are in the spec. We believe we have everything now but definitely <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/1657#issuecomment-197031403">let us know</a> if we missed anything. It was and still is our intent to support the full range of SVG tags and attributes in this release.</p>

<p>Thanks again to everybody who has tried the RC1 and reported issues. It has been extremely important and we wouldn&#39;t be able to do this without your help!</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>We recommend using React from <code>npm</code> and using a tool like browserify or webpack to build your code into a single bundle. To install the two packages:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>npm install --save react@15.0.0-rc.2 react-dom@15.0.0-rc.2</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Remember that by default, React runs extra checks and provides helpful warnings in development mode. When deploying your app, set the <code>NODE_ENV</code> environment variable to <code>production</code> to use the production build of React which does not include the development warnings and runs significantly faster.</p>

<p>If you can’t use <code>npm</code> yet, we provide pre-built browser builds for your convenience, which are also available in the <code>react</code> package on bower.</p>
