<div class="post">
  <p>Today we&#39;re announcing that we&#39;re switching to major revisions for React. The current version is 0.14.7. The next release will be: <strong>15.0.0</strong></p>

<p>This change shouldn&#39;t materially affect most of you. Moving to major semver versions simply helps indicate our commitment to stability and gives us the flexibility to add new backwards-compatible features in minor releases. This means we can have fewer major releases and you won&#39;t have to wait as long to take advantage of improvements to React. Plus, if you&#39;re a component author, this versioning scheme gives you the flexibility to support two major versions of React at the same time so you don&#39;t need to leave anyone behind.</p>

<p>The core of the React API has been stable for years. Our business as well as many of yours all depend heavily on the use of React as a core piece of our infrastructure. We&#39;re committed to the stability as well as the progress of React going forward.</p>

<h2>Bring Everyone Along</h2>

<p>React isn&#39;t just a library but an ecosystem. We know that your applications and ours are not just isolated islands of code. It is a network of your own application code, your own open source components and third party libraries that all depend on React.</p>

<p><img src="/react/img/blog/versioning-1.png" width="403"></p>

<p>Therefore it is important that we don&#39;t just upgrade our own codebases but that we bring our whole community with us. We take the upgrade path very seriously - for everyone.</p>

<p><img src="/react/img/blog/versioning-poll.png" width="596"></p>

<h2>Introducing Minor Releases</h2>

<p>Ideally everyone could just depend on the latest version of React all the time.</p>

<p><img src="/react/img/blog/versioning-2.png" width="463"></p>

<p>We know that in practice that is not possible. In the future, we expect more new additive APIs rather than breakage of existing ones. By moving to major revisions in the semver scheme, we can release new versions without breaking existing ones.</p>

<p><img src="/react/img/blog/versioning-3.png" width="503"></p>

<p>That means that if one component needs a new API, there is no need for any of the other components to do any further work. They remain compatible.</p>

<h2>What Happened to 1.0.0?</h2>

<p>Part of React&#39;s growth and popularity is that it is stable and performant in production. People have long asked what React v1.0 will look. Technically some breaking changes are important to avoid stagnating, but we still achieve stability by making it easy to upgrade. If major version numbers indicate API stability and engender trust that it can be used in production, then we got there a long time ago. There are too many preconceived notions of what v1.0 is. We&#39;re still following semver. We&#39;re just communicating stability by moving the 0 from the beginning to the end.</p>

<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>

<p>Minor revision releases will include deprecation warnings and tips for how to upgrade an API or pattern that will be removed or changed in the future.</p>

<p>We will continue to release <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0pOgY8__JM">codemods</a> for common patterns to make automatic upgrades of your codebase easier.</p>

<p>Once we&#39;ve reached the end of life for a particular major version, we&#39;ll release a new major version where all deprecated APIs have been removed.</p>

<h2>Avoiding The Major Cliff</h2>

<p>If you try to upgrade your component to 16.0.0 you might find that your application no longer works if you still have other dependencies. E.g. if Ryan&#39;s and Jed&#39;s components are only compatible with 15.x.x.</p>

<p><img src="/react/img/blog/versioning-4.png" width="498"></p>

<p>Worst case, you revert back to 15.1.0 for your application. Since you&#39;ll want to use your component, you might also revert that one.</p>

<p><img src="/react/img/blog/versioning-5.png" width="493"></p>

<p>Of course, Ryan and Jed think the same way. If we&#39;re not careful, we can hit a cliff where nobody upgrades. This has happened to many software project ecosystems in the past.</p>

<p>Therefore, we&#39;re committed to making it easy for most components and libraries built on top of React to be compatible with two major versions at the same time. We will do this by introducing new APIs before completely removing the old ones, thereby avoiding those cliffs.</p>

<div class="post">
  <p>Since its 2013 release, React has supported all popular browsers, including Internet Explorer 8 and above. We handle normalizing many quirks present in old browser versions, including event system differences, so that your app code doesn&#39;t have to worry about most browser bugs.</p>

<p>Today, Microsoft <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/End-of-IE-support">discontinued support for older versions of IE</a>. Starting with React v15, we&#39;re discontinuing React DOM&#39;s support for IE 8. We&#39;ve heard that most React DOM apps already don&#39;t support old versions of Internet Explorer, so this shouldn&#39;t affect many people. This change will help us develop faster and make React DOM even better. (We won&#39;t actively remove IE 8–related code quite yet, but we will deprioritize new bugs that are reported. If you need to support IE 8 we recommend you stay on React v0.14.)</p>

<p>React DOM will continue to support IE 9 and above for the foreseeable future.</p>

<div class="post">
  <p>The documentation for <code>componentWillReceiveProps</code> states that <code>componentWillReceiveProps</code> will be invoked when the props change as the result of a rerender. Some people assume this means &quot;if <code>componentWillReceiveProps</code> is called, then the props must have changed&quot;, but that conclusion is logically incorrect.</p>

<p>The guiding principle is one of my favorites from formal logic/mathematics:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A implies B does not imply B implies A</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Example: &quot;If I eat moldy food, then I will get sick&quot; does not imply &quot;if I am sick, then I must have eaten moldy food&quot;. There are many other reasons I could be feeling sick. For instance, maybe the flu is circulating around the office. Similarly, there are many reasons that <code>componentWillReceiveProps</code> might get called, even if the props didn’t change.</p>

<p>If you don’t believe me, call <code>ReactDOM.render()</code> three times with the exact same props, and try to predict the number of times <code>componentWillReceiveProps</code> will get called:</p>

</code></pre></div>
<p>In this case, the answer is &quot;2&quot;. React calls <code>componentWillReceiveProps</code> twice (once for each of the two updates). Both times, the value of &quot;drinks&quot; is printed (ie. the props didn’t change).</p>

<p>To understand why, we need to think about what <em>could</em> have happened. The data <em>could</em> have changed between the initial render and the two subsequent updates, if the code had performed a mutation like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">mydata</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="nx">bar</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;drinks&#39;</span><span class="p">};</span>
<span class="nx">ReactDOM</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">render</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">Component</span> <span class="nx">data</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nx">mydata</span><span class="p">}</span> <span class="o">/&gt;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">container</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="nx">mydata</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">bar</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;food&#39;</span>
<span class="nx">ReactDOM</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">render</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">Component</span> <span class="nx">data</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nx">mydata</span><span class="p">}</span> <span class="o">/&gt;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">container</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="nx">mydata</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">bar</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;noise&#39;</span>
<span class="nx">ReactDOM</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">render</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">Component</span> <span class="nx">data</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nx">mydata</span><span class="p">}</span> <span class="o">/&gt;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">container</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>React has no way of knowing that the data didn’t change. Therefore, React needs to call <code>componentWillReceiveProps</code>, because the component needs to be notified of the new props (even if the new props happen to be the same as the old props).</p>

<p>You might think that React could just use smarter checks for equality, but there are some issues with this idea:</p>

<ul>
<li>The old <code>mydata</code> and the new <code>mydata</code> are actually the same physical object (only the object’s internal value changed). Since the references are triple-equals-equal, doing an equality check doesn’t tell us if the value has changed. The only possible solution would be to have created a deep copy of the data, and then later do a deep comparison - but this can be prohibitively expensive for large data structures (especially ones with cycles).</li>
<li>The <code>mydata</code> object might contain references to functions which have captured variables within closures. There is no way for React to peek into these closures, and thus no way for React to copy them and/or verify equality.</li>
<li>The <code>mydata</code> object might contain references to objects which are re-instantiated during the parent&#39;s render (ie. not triple-equals-equal) but are conceptually equal (ie. same keys and same values). A deep-compare (expensive) could detect this, except that functions present a problem again because there is no reliable way to compare two functions to see if they are semantically equivalent.</li>
</ul>

<p>Given the language constraints, it is sometimes impossible for us to achieve meaningful equality semantics. In such cases, React will call <code>componentWillReceiveProps</code> (even though the props might not have changed) so the component has an opportunity to examine the new props and act accordingly.</p>

<p>As a result, your implementation of <code>componentWillReceiveProps</code> MUST NOT assume that your props have changed. If you want an operation (such as a network request) to occur only when props have changed, your <code>componentWillReceiveProps</code> code needs to check to see if the props actually changed.</p>

  <p>The difference between <strong>components, their instances, and elements</strong> confuses many React beginners. Why are there three different terms to refer to something that is painted on screen?</p>

<h2>Managing the Instances</h2>

<p>If you’re new to React, you probably only worked with component classes and instances before. For example, you may declare a <code>Button</code> <em>component</em> by creating a class. When the app is running, you may have several <em>instances</em> of this component on screen, each with its own properties and local state. This is the traditional object-oriented UI programming. Why introduce <em>elements</em>?</p>

<p>In this traditional UI model, it is up to you to take care of creating and destroying child component instances. If a <code>Form</code> component wants to render a <code>Button</code> component, it needs to create its instance, and manually keep it up to date with any new information.</p>

</code></pre></div>
<p>This is pseudocode, but it is more or less what you end up with when you write composite UI code that behaves consistently in an object-oriented way using a library like Backbone.</p>

<p>Each component instance has to keep references to its DOM node and to the instances of the children components, and create, update, and destroy them when the time is right. The lines of code grow as the square of the number of possible states of the component, and the parents have direct access to their children component instances, making it hard to decouple them in the future.</p>

<p>So how is React different?</p>

<h2>Elements Describe the Tree</h2>

<p>In React, this is where the <em>elements</em> come to rescue. <strong>An element is a plain object <em>describing</em> a component instance or DOM node and its desired properties.</strong> It contains only information about the component type (for example, a <code>Button</code>), its properties (for example, its <code>color</code>), and any child elements inside it.</p>

<p>An element is not an actual instance. Rather, it is a way to tell React what you <em>want</em> to see on the screen. You can’t call any methods on the element. It’s just an immutable description object with two fields: <code>type: (string | ReactClass)</code> and <code>props: Object</code><sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<h3>DOM Elements</h3>

<p>When an element’s <code>type</code> is a string, it represents a DOM node with that tag name, and <code>props</code> correspond to its attributes. This is what React will render. For example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nx">type</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;button&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="nx">props</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">className</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;button button-blue&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="nx">children</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
      <span class="nx">type</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;b&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
      <span class="nx">props</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nx">children</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;OK!&#39;</span>
      <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This element is just a way to represent the following HTML as a plain object:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;button</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&#39;button button-blue&#39;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;b&gt;</span>
    OK!
  <span class="nt">&lt;/b&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/button&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Note how elements can be nested. By convention, when we want to create an element tree, we specify one or more child elements as the <code>children</code> prop of their containing element.</p>

<p>What’s important is that both child and parent elements are <em>just descriptions and not the actual instances</em>. They don’t refer to anything on the screen when you create them. You can create them and throw them away, and it won’t matter much.</p>

<p>React elements are easy to traverse, don’t need to be parsed, and of course they are much lighter than the actual DOM elements—they’re just objects!</p>

<h3>Component Elements</h3>

<p>However, the <code>type</code> of an element can also be a function or a class corresponding to a React component:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nx">type</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nx">Button</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="nx">props</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">color</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;blue&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="nx">children</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;OK!&#39;</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This is the core idea of React.</p>

<p><strong>An element describing a component is also an element, just like an element describing the DOM node. They can be nested and mixed with each other.</strong></p>

<p>This feature lets you define a <code>DangerButton</code> component as a <code>Button</code> with a specific <code>color</code> property value without worrying about whether <code>Button</code> renders to a DOM <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>, a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, or something else entirely:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span class="kr">const</span> <span class="nx">DangerButton</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">({</span> <span class="nx">children</span> <span class="p">})</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">({</span>
  <span class="nx">type</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nx">Button</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="nx">props</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">color</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;red&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="nx">children</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nx">children</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">});</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>You can mix and match DOM and component elements in a single element tree:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span class="kr">const</span> <span class="nx">DeleteAccount</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">({</span>
  <span class="nx">type</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;div&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="nx">props</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">children</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="p">[{</span>
      <span class="nx">type</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;p&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
      <span class="nx">props</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nx">children</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Are you sure?&#39;</span>
      <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="p">},</span> <span class="p">{</span>
      <span class="nx">type</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nx">DangerButton</span><span class="p">,</span>
      <span class="nx">props</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nx">children</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Yep&#39;</span>
      <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="p">},</span> <span class="p">{</span>
      <span class="nx">type</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nx">Button</span><span class="p">,</span>
      <span class="nx">props</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nx">color</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;blue&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="nx">children</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Cancel&#39;</span>
      <span class="p">}</span>
   <span class="p">}]</span>
<span class="p">});</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Or, if you prefer JSX:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span class="kr">const</span> <span class="nx">DeleteAccount</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">(</span>
  <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">div</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
    <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">p</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="nx">Are</span> <span class="nx">you</span> <span class="nx">sure</span><span class="o">?&lt;</span><span class="err">/p&gt;</span>
    <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">DangerButton</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="nx">Yep</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="err">/DangerButton&gt;</span>
    <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">Button</span> <span class="nx">color</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;blue&#39;</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="nx">Cancel</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="err">/Button&gt;</span>
  <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="err">/div&gt;</span>
<span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This mix and matching helps keep components decoupled from each other, as they can express both <em>is-a</em> and <em>has-a</em> relationships exclusively through composition:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Button</code> is a DOM <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> with specific properties.</li>
<li><code>DangerButton</code> is a <code>Button</code> with specific properties.</li>
<li><code>DeleteAccount</code> contains a <code>Button</code> and a <code>DangerButton</code> inside a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Components Encapsulate Element Trees</h3>

<p>When React sees an element with a function or class <code>type</code>, it knows to ask <em>that</em> component what element it renders to, given the corresponding <code>props</code>.</p>

<p>When it sees this element:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nx">type</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nx">Button</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="nx">props</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">color</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;blue&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="nx">children</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;OK!&#39;</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>React will ask <code>Button</code> what it renders to. The <code>Button</code> will return this element:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nx">type</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;button&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="nx">props</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">className</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;button button-blue&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="nx">children</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
      <span class="nx">type</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;b&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
      <span class="nx">props</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nx">children</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;OK!&#39;</span>
      <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>React will repeat this process until it knows the underlying DOM tag elements for every component on the page.</p>

<p>React is like a child asking “what is Y” for every “X is Y” you explain to them until they figure out every little thing in the world.</p>

<p>Remember the <code>Form</code> example above? It can be written in React as follows<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span class="kr">const</span> <span class="nx">Form</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">({</span> <span class="nx">isSubmitted</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">buttonText</span> <span class="p">})</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">isSubmitted</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// Form submitted! Return a message element.</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">{</span>
      <span class="nx">type</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nx">Message</span><span class="p">,</span>
      <span class="nx">props</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nx">text</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Success!&#39;</span>
      <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="p">};</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>

  <span class="c1">// Form is still visible! Return a button element.</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">type</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nx">Button</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="nx">props</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
      <span class="nx">children</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nx">buttonText</span><span class="p">,</span>
      <span class="nx">color</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;blue&#39;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
  <span class="p">};</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>That’s it! For a React component, props are the input, and an element tree is the output.</p>

<p><strong>The returned element tree can contain both elements describing DOM nodes, and elements describing other components. This lets you compose independent parts of UI without relying on their internal DOM structure.</strong></p>

<p>We let React create, update, and destroy instances. We <em>describe</em> them with elements we return from the components, and React takes care of managing the instances.</p>

<h3>Components Can Be Classes or Functions</h3>

<p>In the code above, <code>Form</code>, <code>Message</code>, and <code>Button</code> are React components. They can either be written as functions, like above, or as classes descending from <code>React.Component</code>. These three ways to declare a component are mostly equivalent:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span class="c1">// 1) As a function of props</span>

<p>When a component is defined as a class, it is a little bit more powerful than a functional component. It can store some local state and perform custom logic when the corresponding DOM node is created or destroyed.</p>

<p>A functional component is less powerful but is simpler, and acts like a class component with just a single <code>render()</code> method. Unless you need features available only in a class, we encourage you to use functional components instead.</p>

<p><strong>However, whether functions or classes, fundamentally they are all components to React. They take the props as their input, and return the elements as their output.</strong></p>

<h3>Top-Down Reconciliation</h3>

<p>When you call:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span class="nx">ReactDOM</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">render</span><span class="p">({</span>
  <span class="nx">type</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nx">Form</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="nx">props</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">isSubmitted</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="kc">false</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="nx">buttonText</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;OK!&#39;</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">},</span> <span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">getElementById</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;root&#39;</span><span class="p">));</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>React will ask the <code>Form</code> component what element tree it returns, given those <code>props</code>. It will gradually “refine” its understanding of your component tree in terms of simpler primitives:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span class="c1">// React: You told me this...</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nx">type</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nx">Form</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="nx">props</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">isSubmitted</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="kc">false</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="nx">buttonText</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;OK!&#39;</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="c1">// React: ...And Form told me this...</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nx">type</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nx">Button</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="nx">props</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">children</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;OK!&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="nx">color</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;blue&#39;</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="c1">// React: ...and Button told me this! I guess I&#39;m done.</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nx">type</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;button&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="nx">props</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">className</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;button button-blue&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="nx">children</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
      <span class="nx">type</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;b&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>

      <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This is a part of the process that React calls <a href="/react/docs/reconciliation.html">reconciliation</a> which starts when you call <a href="/react/docs/top-level-api.html#reactdom.render"><code>ReactDOM.render()</code></a> or <a href="/react/docs/component-api.html#setstate"><code>setState()</code></a>. By the end of the reconciliation, React knows the result DOM tree, and a renderer like <code>react-dom</code> or <code>react-native</code> applies the minimal set of changes necessary to update the DOM nodes (or the platform-specific views in case of React Native).</p>

<p>This gradual refining process is also the reason React apps are easy to optimize. If some parts of your component tree become too large for React to visit efficiently, you can tell it to <a href="/react/docs/advanced-performance.html">skip this “refining” and diffing certain parts of the tree if the relevant props have not changed</a>. It is very fast to calculate whether the props have changed if they are immutable, so React and immutability work great together, and can provide great optimizations with the minimal effort.</p>

<p>You might have noticed that this blog entry talks a lot about components and elements, and not so much about the instances. The truth is, instances have much less importance in React than in most object-oriented UI frameworks.</p>

<p>Only components declared as classes have instances, and you never create them directly: React does that for you. While <a href="/react/docs/more-about-refs.html">mechanisms for a parent component instance to access a child component instance</a> exist, they are only used for imperative actions (such as setting focus on a field), and should generally be avoided.</p>

<p>React takes care of creating an instance for every class component, so you can write components in an object-oriented way with methods and local state, but other than that, instances are not very important in the React’s programming model and are managed by React itself.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>An <em>element</em> is a plain object describing what you want to appear on the screen in terms of the DOM nodes or other components. Elements can contain other elements in their props. Creating a React element is cheap. Once an element is created, it is never mutated.</p>

<p>A <em>component</em> can be declared in several different ways. It can be a class with a <code>render()</code> method. Alternatively, in simple cases, it can be defined as a function. In either case, it takes props as an input, and returns an element tree as the output.</p>

<p>When a component receives some props as an input, it is because a particular parent component returned an element with its <code>type</code> and these props. This is why people say that the props flows one way in React: from parents to children.</p>

<p>An <em>instance</em> is what you refer to as <code>this</code> in the component class you write. It is useful for <a href="/react/docs/component-api.html">storing local state and reacting to the lifecycle events</a>.</p>

<p>Functional components don’t have instances at all. Class components have instances, but you never need to create a component instance directly—React takes care of this.</p>

<p>Finally, to create elements, use <a href="/react/docs/top-level-api.html#react.createelement"><code>React.createElement()</code></a>, <a href="/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html">JSX</a>, or an <a href="/react/docs/top-level-api.html#react.createfactory">element factory helper</a>. Don’t write elements as plain objects in the real code—just know that they are plain objects under the hood.</p>
