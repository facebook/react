  <p>I am thrilled to announced that we will be organizing another diversity scholarship program for the upcoming React.js Conf! The tech industry is suffering from a lack of diversity, but it&#39;s important to us that we have a thriving community that is made up of people with a variety of experiences and viewpoints.</p>

<p>When we ran this program last year, we had <em>over 200</em> people apply for only 10 tickets. There were so many people that we wanted to bring in but we couldn&#39;t. The results were still awesome, and we had bright individuals from around the world attending who would have otherwise been unable to. These attendees took part in discussions at the conference and brought perspectives that we might not have otherwise seen there.</p>

<p>This year we&#39;re excited to bring back the scholarship, but we&#39;ve set aside <strong>40 tickets</strong> because we really believe that it&#39;s important to do our best to make sure we have an even more diverse audience.</p>

<p>This is something I&#39;m personally really excited to be a part of. I know the rest of the team is as well. We&#39;re really proud to have everyone at Facebook providing support and funding for this.</p>

<p>The details of the scholarship are provided below (or you can <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/PEmKj8oUp4">go directly to the application</a>). I encourage you to apply! If you don&#39;t feel like you are eligible yourself, you can still help – send this along to friends, family, coworkers, acquaintances, or anybody who might be interested. And even if you haven&#39;t spoken before, please consider <a href="http://conf.reactjs.com/">submitting a proposal for a talk</a> (either 30 minutes or just 5 minutes) - we&#39;re hoping to have a very diverse group of speakers in addition to attendees.</p>

<hr>

<p>Facebook is excited to announce that we are now accepting applications for the React.js Conf Diversity Scholarship!</p>

<p>Beginning today, those studying or working in computer science or a related field can apply for a partial scholarship to attend the React.js Conf in San Francisco, CA on February 22 &amp; 23, 2016.</p>

<p>React opens a world of new possibilities such as server-side rendering, real-time updates, different rendering targets like SVG and canvas. React Native makes is easy to use the same concepts and technologies to build native mobile experiences on iOS and Android. Join us at React.js Conf to shape the future of client-side applications! For more information about the React.js conference, please see <a href="http://conf.reactjs.com/">the website</a>.</p>

<p>At Facebook, we believe that anyone anywhere can make a positive impact by developing products to make the world more open and connected to the people and things they care about. Given the current realities of the tech industry and the lack of representation of communities we seek to serve, applicants currently under-represented in Computer Science and related fields are strongly encouraged to apply. Facebook will make determinations on scholarship recipients in its sole discretion. Facebook complies with all equal opportunity laws.</p>

<p>To apply for the scholarship, please visit the application page: <strong><a href="http://goo.gl/forms/PEmKj8oUp4">http://goo.gl/forms/PEmKj8oUp4</a></strong></p>

  <p>It&#39;s time for another installment of React patch releases! We didn&#39;t break anything in v0.14.2 but we do have a couple of other bugs we&#39;re fixing. The biggest change in this release is actually an addition of a new built file. We heard from a number of people that they still need the ability to use React to render to a string on the client. While the use cases are not common and there are other ways to achieve this, we decided that it&#39;s still valuable to support. So we&#39;re now building <code>react-dom-server.js</code>, which will be shipped to Bower and in the <code>dist/</code> directory of the <code>react-dom</code> package on npm. This file works the same way as <code>react-dom.js</code> and therefore requires that the primary React build has already been included on the page.</p>

<p>The release is now available for download:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>React</strong><br>

  <p>We have a quick update following the release of 0.14.1 last week. It turns out we broke a couple things in the development build of React when using Internet Explorer. Luckily it was only the development build, so your production applications were unaffected. This release is mostly to address those issues. There is one notable change if consuming React from npm. For the <code>react-dom</code> package, we moved <code>react</code> from a regular dependency to a peer dependency. This will impact very few people as these two are typically installed together at the top level, but it will fix some issues with dependencies of installed components also using <code>react</code> as a peer dependency.</p>

<p>The release is now available for download:</p>

  <p>TL;DR: Slack decided that Reactiflux had too many members and disabled new invites. Reactiflux is moving to Discord. Join us: <a href="http://join.reactiflux.com/">http://join.reactiflux.com</a></p>

<h2>What happened with Slack?</h2>

<p>A few weeks ago, Reactiflux reached 7,500 members on Slack. Shortly after, Slack decided we were too big and disabled invites. There was no way for new users to join. Many of us were sad and upset. We loved Slack.  Our community was built around it.</p>

<p>We reached out to Slack several times, but their decision was firm. Our large community caused performance issues. Slack wants to focus on building a great product for teams, not necessarily large open communities. Losing focus and building for too many use cases always leads to product bloat, and eventually a decrease in quality.</p>

<h2>So… why Discord?</h2>

<p>After a <a href="https://github.com/reactiflux/volunteers/issues/25">long and thorough debate</a>, Discord quickly emerged as the most promising service. After just a few days, 400 members had joined the Discord server, and many already loved it.</p>

<h3>Easiest to join</h3>

<p>Discord is the easiest platform to join. New users can immediately join our conversations without having to create an account. All they need to do is provide a name. No permission granting, no password, no email confirmation.</p>

<p>This is critically useful for us, and will make Reactiflux even more open and accessible.</p>

<h3>Great apps</h3>

<p>Out of all of the services we’ve tried, Discord’s apps are by far the most polished. They are well designed, easy to use, and surprisingly fast. In addition to the web app, they have mobile apps on both iOS and Android as well as desktop apps for OS X and Windows, with Linux support coming soon.</p>

<p>Their desktop apps are built with React and Electron, and their iOS app is built with React Native.</p>

<h3>Moderation tools</h3>

<p>So far, we’ve been fortunate not to have to deal with spammers and trolls. As our community continues to grow, that might change. Unsurprisingly, Discord is the only app we’ve seen with legitimate moderation tools. It was built for gaming communities, after all.</p>

<h3>Great multiple Server support</h3>

<p>Your  Discord account works with every Discord server, which is the equivalent of a Slack team. You don’t need to create a new account every time you join a new team. You can join new servers in one click, and it’s very easy to switch between them. Discord messages also work across servers, so your personal conversations are not scoped to a single server.</p>

<p>Instead of having one huge, crowded Reactiflux server, we can branch off closely related channels into sub-servers. Communities will start overlapping, and it will be easy to interact with non-Reactiflux channels.</p>

<h3>It’s hosted</h3>

<p>Self-hosted apps require maintenance. We’re all busy, and we can barely find the time to keep our landing page up to date and running smoothly. More than anything, we need a stable platform, and we don’t have the resources to guarantee that right now.</p>

<p>It’s a much safer bet to offload the hosting to Discord, who is already keeping the lights on for all their users.</p>

<h3>We like the team</h3>

<p>And they seem to like us back. They are excited for us to join them, and they’ve been very responsive to our feedback and suggestions.</p>

<p>They implemented code syntax highlighting just a few days after we told them we needed it.</p>

<p>Discord’s team has already built a solid suite of apps, and they have shown us how much they care about their users. We’re excited to see how they will continue to improve their product.</p>

<h2>And what’s the catch?</h2>

<p>Choosing the best chat service is subjective. There are a million reasons why Discord <em>might be</em> a terrible idea. Here are the ones that we’re most worried about:</p>

<h3>Difficult channel management</h3>

<p>Channel management seems to be the biggest issue. There is no way to opt out of channels; you can only mute them. And you can only mute channels one by one. There is no way to star channels, and channels can only be sorted on the server level. Each user will see the list of channels in the same order.</p>

<p>As the number of channels grow, it will be challenging to keep things in order. Branching off sub-servers will help, and we will keep an easily accessible directory of channels across our main server and all of the sub-servers.</p>

<p>We can build simple tools to make channel lookup easier, and the Discord team is working on improvements that should make this more manageable.</p>

<h3>No Search</h3>

<p>Lack of search is clearly a bummer, but Discord is working on it. Search is coming!</p>

<h3>Firewall</h3>

<p>A couple of users aren’t able to access Discord at work since other corporate filters classify it as a gaming application. This sucks, but it seems to be a  rare case. So far, it seems only to affect 0.6% of our current community (3/500).</p>

<p>We hope that these users can get Discord&#39;s domains whitelisted, and we’ll try to find a solution if this is a widespread issue. The Discord team is aware of the issue as well.</p>

<h2>Is Discord going to disappear tomorrow?</h2>

<p>Probably not tomorrow. They have 14 people <a href="https://discordapp.com/company">full time</a>, and they’ve raised money from some of the best investors in Silicon Valley, including <a href="http://www.benchmark.com/">Benchmark</a> and <a href="http://www.accel.com/companies/">Accel</a>.</p>

<p>By focusing on gaming communities, Discord has differentiated itself from the many other communication apps. Discord is well received and has a rapidly growing user base.  They plan to keep their basic offerings free for unlimited users and hope to make money with premium offerings (themes, add-ons, content, and more).</p>

<p><em>Note: Jordan Hawker’s thorough <a href="http://jhawk.co/team-chat-comparison">research</a> made our decision a lot easier.</em></p>
