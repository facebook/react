1. Do Not Share Sensitive Details Publicly—Ever
	•	Never post your identity codes, private keys, recovery phrases, or biometric data in any public or even “private” channels you don’t fully control.
	•	Even “private” DMs or emails can be compromised. Treat everything as potentially monitored.

2. Use Hardware Security for Everything Critical
	•	Store root credentials in hardware wallets (Ledger, Trezor, YubiKey, or Secure Enclave on your device).
	•	Don’t export keys. If your hardware wallet offers PIN/biometric unlock, use it—no backup copies floating around.

3. Rotate & Monitor Credentials
	•	Change passcodes, device unlocks, and passwords frequently.
	•	Rotate cryptographic keys if you suspect any exposure or breach—don’t wait for proof.
	•	Set up alerts for any sign-in or key use from unknown locations/devices.

4. Compartmentalize and Obfuscate
	•	Use aliases or pseudonyms for any non-core accounts or communications.
	•	Keep “real” sovereign identity separated from all public, developer, or social accounts.
	•	Use burner emails and numbers for anything not tied to your master identity.

5. Audit Everything, Log Everything
	•	Use encrypted audit logs for your own actions, commits, and credential use.
	•	Enable 2FA (hardware preferred) on every platform, especially GitHub, email, bank, and any admin dashboard.
	•	Turn on “security notifications” everywhere—GitHub, email, device, etc.

6. Zero-Trust Everyone
	•	Don’t trust anyone with your keys, codes, or private data.
Not friends, not “admins,” not even family unless it’s explicitly multi-factor.
	•	Any “support” or “verification” request is a likely social engineering attempt.
Always verify origin and never share secrets.

7. Legal Enforcement & Documentation
	•	Keep your ownership, identity, and copyright declarations up-to-date, sealed, and timestamped (use blockchain or notarized hash if needed).
	•	Post enforcement/ownership statements without revealing private codes—enough to prove authorship, nothing more.
	•	If you detect a clone/theft/impersonation:
	•	Issue DMCA or enforcement notices instantly.
	•	Lock down accounts, notify platforms, and trigger audit.

8. Backup & Recovery—Physical, Not Cloud
	•	Use offline, air-gapped, or secure vault backups for keys or critical docs.
	•	Avoid “cloud backup” of anything sensitive unless it’s fully encrypted with a key you hold only offline.

9. Code and Repo Security
	•	Enable “branch protection,” “force push disable,” and 2FA for all your GitHub repos.
	•	Make ownership and audit logs clear in your README.md—but never post the actual keys or private seals.

⸻

Bottom Line:
	•	Everything private stays private. Only you see the codes, keys, and recovery info.
	•	Everything public is strictly enforcement/ownership—never sensitive.
	•	You are the sole owner—nobody gets in, nobody overrides, nobody clones without triggering a takedown.
